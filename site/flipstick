	The old saying, “<strong>It’s all who you know</strong>,” used to feel so defeating.
</p><p>
	I wanted to be a famous musician, but I didn’t know any famous people.
	I didn’t grow up in Hollywood.
	None of my friends were successful.
	Fame was a secret insider’s group.
</p><p>
	So when I heard, “It’s all who you know,” it felt like the rest of that sentence was, “and you don’t know anyone. So forget it.”
</p><p>
	One day in college we had a guest speaker who was a top executive at BMI. 
</p><p>
	On his way into class I overheard him say he was hungry.
	He had come straight to our school without lunch, so when the teacher told him it was a two-hour class, he groaned.
</p><p>
	Because everyone was still getting seated, I quickly ran out to the hall, called the local pizza shop, and ordered a few pizzas to be sent to our classroom.
</p><p>
	After they arrived, he laughed and said, “Good move. I owe you one.”
	He gave me his card after class, and suggested I keep in touch.
</p><p>
	For the next two years, he took my calls and gave me all kinds of advice about the music business.
	When I graduated college, he got me a great job at Warner/Chappell Music Publishing in New York City.
	He heard they were hiring, called them to say their search was done, and that was that.
	I started work that week.
</p><p>
	A year later, I realized “It’s all who you know,” doesn’t have to be depressing.
	I just never considered it could work in my favor.
</p><p>
	Then I realized the profound conclusion.
<strong>
	Everything that seems depressing can be flipped to work in my favor.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Every deal that’s bad for someone is good for someone else.
<strong>
	So instead of moaning about the bad side, you can take the good side.
</strong>
</p><p>
	If you think corporate radio is keeping your music from being heard, start a radio station!
	Look at <a href="http://somafm.com/about/history.html">the history of SomaFM.com</a> for an example.
</p><p>
	If you think banks have an unfair advantage, you can start a bank!
	Look at <a href="https://www.simple.com/about-us">simple.com</a> for an example.
</p><p>
	In 1997, I thought distribution for musicians sucked.
	So <a href="https://sivers.org/a">I started CD Baby</a>.
	Now distribution doesn’t suck anymore.
</p><p>
	If you live in a democracy and don’t like the law, you can even change the law!
</p><p>
<strong>
	You can flip anything in your favor.
</strong>
	It’s easier than ever for you to replace a broken system, and never feel helpless again.
