<h2>my notes</h2>
<p id="booknotes">
We are looking for someone who has the predominant character traits of the people who raised us.<br>
Trying to re-create the environment of childhood.<br>
A compelling need to heal old childhood wounds.<br>
<br>
Fusers and isolaters tend to marry each other.<br>
<br>
An "isolater": people who unconsciously push others away.<br>
They keep people at a distance because they need to have "a lot of space".<br>
They want the freedom to come and go.<br>
They don't want to be "pinned down" to a single relationship.<br>
Underneath this cool exterior is a two-year-old who was not allowed to satisfy a natural need for independence.<br>
<br>
A "fuser": people who seem to have an insatiable need for closeness.<br>
Fusers want to "do things together" all the time.<br>
If people fail to show up at the appointed time, they feel abandoned.<br>
The thought of divorce fills them with terror.<br>
They crave physical affection and reassurance, and often need to stay in constant verbal contact.<br>
Underneath all this clinging behavior is a young child whose parents pushed them away when they come running to them for comfort.<br>
<br>
Children instinctively observe the choices their parents make, the freedoms and pleasures they allow themselves, the talents they develop, the abilities they ignore, and the rules they follow.<br>
All of this has a profound effect on children: "This is how we live. This is how to get through life."<br>
Whether children accept their parents' model or rebel.<br>
<br>
Separate entities:<br>
1. Your "lost self," those parts of your being that you had to repress because of the demands of society.<br>
2. Your "false self," the facade that you erected in order to fill the void created by this repression and by a lack of adequate nurturing.<br>
3. Your "disowned self," the negative parts of your false self that met with disapproval and were therefore denied.<br>
<br>
Someone who stirs within us a deep sense of recognition:<br>
"This is the one I've been looking for! This is the one who will make up for the wounds of the past!"<br>
What people are doing in these yin/yang matches is trying to reclaim their lost selves by proxy.<br>
Being emotionally attached to this person made his or her attributes feel a part of a larger, more fulfilled you.<br>
It was as if you had merged with the other person and become whole.<br>
A person who grew up repressing his or her feelings will choose someone who is unusually expressive.<br>
<br>
Think for a minute about some part of your being that you feel is deficient.<br>
<br>
Once a relationship seems secure, a psychological switch is triggered deep in the old brain that activates all the latent infantile wishes.<br>
It is as if the wounded child within takes over.<br>
Says the child, "I've been good enough long enough to ensure that this person is going to stay around for a while. Let's see the payoff."<br>
<br>
Use of global words like "always" and "never" is an indication that someone is in a regressive state.<br>
Young children have a hard time distinguishing between past and present; whatever is happening at this moment has always happened in the past and will always happen in the future.<br>
<br>
People react to their partners as if they were carbon copies of their parents, even though not all of their traits are the same.<br>
In their compelling need to work on unfinished business, they project the missing parental traits onto their partners.<br>
Then, by treating their partners as if they actually had these traits, they manage to provoke the desired response.<br>
<br>
All people have a dark side to their nature, a part of their being that they try to ignore.<br>
For the most part, these are creative adaptations to childhood wounds.<br>
People also acquire negative traits by observing their parents.<br>
<br>
People try to exorcise their denied negative traits by projecting them onto their mates.<br>
They look at their partners and criticize all the things they dislike and deny in themselves.<br>
<br>
In most interactions with your partner, you are actually safer when you lower your defenses than when you keep them engaged, because your partner becomes an ally, not an enemy.<br>
<br>
Your love relationship has a hidden purpose - the healing of childhood wounds.<br>
A relationship that fosters maximum psychological growth - to be safe, to be healed, and to be whole.<br>
<br>
Create a more accurate image of your partner.<br>
At the very moment of attraction, you began fusing your lover with your primary caretakers.<br>
Later you projected your negative traits onto your partner, further obscuring your partner's essential reality.<br>
Let go of these illusions and begin to see more of your partner's truth.<br>
See your partner not as your savior but as another wounded human being, struggling to be healed.<br>
<br>
In an unconscious partnership, you believe that the way to have a good relationship is to pick the right partner.<br>
In a conscious partnership you realize you have to be the right partner.<br>
<br>
He was locked into a view of the world that went something like this:<br>
Wandering around the world were people on whose foreheads were stamped the words "Friend of Walter," and his job was merely to search until he found them.<br>
"There are no friends out there. What you want does not exist. All people in the world are strangers. If you want a friend, you're going to have to go out and make one!"<br>
<br>
What would it be like if you lived in the relationship of your dreams?<br>
Defining the vision turns your energy away from past and present disappointments toward a more hopeful future.<br>
<br>
We start to act out our feelings rather than put them into words.<br>
As an example, it's easier to stay late at work than to tell your partner that you feel unhappy every time you walk in the front door.<br>
<br>
Fidelity and commitment create the feeling of safety that allows couples to work on their unconscious issues and heal.<br>
<br>
People operate out of the erroneous belief that their partners know exactly what it is that they want.<br>
When their partners fail to satisfy their secret desires, they assume that they are deliberately depriving them of pleasure.<br>
This makes them want to deprive their partners of pleasure.<br>
<br>
They just can't think of anything their partners can do for them. They don't seem to have any needs or desires.<br>
What they are really doing is hiding behind the psychic shield they erected as children to protect themselves from overbearing parents.<br>
They discovered early in life that one way to maintain a feeling of autonomy around their intrusive parents was to keep their thoughts and feelings to themselves.<br>
When they deprived their parents of this valuable information, their parents were less able to invade their space.<br>
After a while, many isolaters do the ultimate disappearing act and hide their feelings from themselves.<br>
<br>
Many of your repetitious, emotional criticisms of your partner are disguised statements of your own unmet needs.<br>
