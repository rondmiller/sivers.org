<h2>my notes</h2>
<p id="booknotes">
Virtue (meaning, self-control, courage, justice, and wisdom) is happiness.<br>
<br>
Your perceptions of things cause most of your trouble, not the things themselves. Control your perceptions.<br>
<br>
Accept what’s outside your control.<br>
<br>
You can only control and rely on your reason to choose how you categorize, respond, and reorient ourselves to external events.<br>
<br>
Use your will to find the wisdom and perspective to deal with anything.<br>
<br>
Differentiate between what you can change and what you can’t.<br>
<br>
Learn because you want to be freer, fear less, and achieve peace.<br>
<br>
Direct your efforts at a cause or a purpose.<br>
<br>
Get clarity about who you are and what you stand for.<br>
<br>
This is what the mind is here to do:<br>
* choice to do and think right<br>
* refusal of temptation<br>
* yearning to be better<br>
* repulsion of negativity, of bad influences, of what isn’t true<br>
* preparation for what lies ahead<br>
* purpose your guiding principle and highest priority<br>
* assent to be free of deception about what’s inside and outside your control<br>
See everything else as pollution or a corruption.<br>
<br>
Harmless indulgences become full-blown addictions.<br>
Little compulsions chip away at your freedom.<br>
Reclaim the freedom to abstain.<br>
<br>
Use reason to take the crooked, confusing, and overwhelming nature of external events and make them orderly.<br>
<br>
Don’t eliminate outside influences or run away to quiet and solitude.<br>
Serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgment, not your environment.<br>
If you seek to avoid all disruptions to tranquility, you will never be successful.<br>
<br>
Study philosophy to break yourself of rote behavior.<br>
<br>
Recall the events of the previous day.<br>
Notice what contributed to your happiness and what detracted from it.<br>
<br>
Read carefully. Don’t be satisfied with a rough understanding of the whole.<br>
<br>
Don’t agree too quickly with those who have a lot to say about something.<br>
<br>
Limit your action or inaction to only what’s in keeping with the needs of your own preparation.<br>
<br>
Have a mantra.<br>
<br>
Look at what the wise run away from, and what they seek out.<br>
<br>
Keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand.<br>
<br>
Give up every distraction, emotional subversion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint.<br>
<br>
If some regard you as important, distrust yourself.<br>
<br>
One of the most powerful things you can do as a human being in your hyperconnected, 24/7 media world is say: “I don’t know.” Or, more provocatively: “I don’t care.”<br>
<br>
The nearer you come to a calm mind, the closer you are to strength.<br>
<br>
Don’t give way to anger and discontent.<br>
<br>
Strength is the ability to maintain a hold of yourself.<br>
<br>
Getting anxious is wanting something outside your control.<br>
<br>
You can be invincible if you are not upset by anything outside your reasoned choice.<br>
<br>
Think before you act.<br>
Impulses of all kinds are going to come, and your work is to control them, like bringing a dog to heel.<br>
Submit every impulse to the claims of justice, and protect your clear conviction in every appearance.<br>
<br>
Endure a turbulent life, but don’t choose it.<br>
Choose to be at peace, rather than at war.<br>
<br>
The paranoid often destroy themselves quicker than any enemy.<br>
<br>
Cultivate the power to hold no opinion about a negative thing.<br>
Practice the ability of having absolutely no thoughts about something.<br>
Act as if you had no idea it ever occurred.<br>
Or that you’ve never heard of it before.<br>
Let it become irrelevant or nonexistent to you.<br>
<br>
You have all the reason and intelligence you need.<br>
The tough part is deferring to it and using it.<br>
Make sure that your mind is in charge, not your emotions, not your immediate physical sensations.<br>
<br>
As pleasurable as these activities might seem, they ruin your chance at happiness here and now:<br>
* anticipating some future event<br>
* passionately imagining something you desire<br>
* looking forward to some happy scenario<br>
<br>
You are invincible if you want nothing, because nothing lies outside your control.<br>
<br>
Speak only when you’re certain that what you’ll say isn’t better left unsaid.<br>
<br>
Harm comes from your own belief about the abuse, not the abuse itself.<br>
<br>
If someone sends you an angry email but you never see it, did it actually happen?<br>
<br>
Situations require your participation in order to be considered “bad”.<br>
<br>
Seneca was wealthy and famous - yet he was a Stoic.<br>
He had many material things yet he was indifferent to them.<br>
He enjoyed them while they were there, but he accepted that they might someday disappear.<br>
<br>
Indifference is solid middle ground. It’s not about avoidance or shunning, but rather not giving any possible outcome more power or preference.<br>
<br>
The good are virtues.<br>
The bad are the vices.<br>
The indifferent include wealth, health, life, death, pleasure, and pain.<br>
<br>
Don’t set your heart on so many things. Focus. Prioritize.<br>
<br>
You become a philosopher when you exercise your guiding reason and start to question the emotions and beliefs and even language that others take for granted.<br>
<br>
Even what you get for free has a cost, if only in what you pay to store it - in your garage and in your mind.<br>
<br>
You hand your mind over willingly to social media, what other people are doing, thinking, or saying.<br>
<br>
Choose whether to be loved by these friends and remain the same person, or to become a better person at the cost of those friends.<br>
<br>
You can remove most sins if you have a witness standing by as you are about to go wrong.<br>
You should each have your own Cato - a great and noble person you can allow into your minds and use to guide your actions, even when they’re not physically present.<br>
The indifferent spectator can stand witness to your behavior.<br>
<br>
Whenever you find yourself blaming providence, turn it around in your mind and you will see that what has happened is in keeping with reason.<br>
<br>
All things are guided by reason - but that it is a vast and universal reason that you cannot always see.<br>
Notice how often you look for more.<br>
<br>
If you are wanting the past to be still here, you’re neglecting the present moment.<br>
<br>
Work can’t overwhelm you. This is impossible.<br>
External objects have no access to your mind. Those emotions you feel come from the inside, not the outside.<br>
<br>
What you willingly generate in your mind, that’s on you.<br>
You can’t blame other people for making you feel stressed<br>
<br>
People seek retreats for themselves in the country, by the sea, or in the mountains.<br>
You can, at any moment, find such a retreat in yourself.<br>
For nowhere can you find a more peaceful and less busy retreat than in your own soul - especially if on close inspection it is filled with ease, which is nothing more than being well-ordered.<br>
Treat yourself often to this retreat and be renewed.<br>
<br>
Study, yes, but go live your life as well. It’s the only way that you’ll actually understand what any of it means.<br>
It’s only from your actions and choices that it will be possible to see whether you took any of the teachings to heart.<br>
<br>
Freedom isn’t secured by filling up on your heart’s desire but by removing your desire.<br>
<br>
Unnecessary things are not worth it at any price.<br>
<br>
A dog that’s allowed to chase cars will chase cars.<br>
A child who is never given any boundaries will become spoiled.<br>
An investor without discipline is not an investor - he’s a gambler.<br>
A mind that isn’t in control of itself will be jerked around by external events and unquestioned impulses.<br>
<br>
Put in place training and habits now to replace ignorance and ill discipline.<br>
<br>
If you shove your feet into tiny shoes each day, your feet begin to take on that form.<br>
The same is true for your mind.<br>
If you hold a perpetually negative outlook, soon enough everything you encounter will seem negative.<br>
<br>
Drama, combat, and terror wipe out your sacred principles, whenever your mind entertains them uncritically or lets them slip in.<br>
<br>
Stop and ask: OK, what do I really want? What am I actually after here?<br>
Notice the contradictory and inconsistent wishes<br>
<br>
Prepare yourself for negativity when you first rise in the morning, because you’ve prepared for it, you’ll be able to act with patience, forgiveness, and understanding.<br>
<br>
Our inner fortress is impenetrable.<br>
Stuff cannot touch the soul.<br>
<br>
Instead of asking for a way to sleep with her, try asking for a way to stop desiring to sleep with her.<br>
Instead of a way to not lose your child, try asking for a way to lose your fear of this.<br>
<br>
Practice not letting people know who you are - keep your philosophy to yourself for a bit.<br>
<br>
Fight your biases and preconceptions: because they are a liability.<br>
You’re not as smart and as wise as we’d like to think you are.<br>
<br>
Honor what you do not know, and then set that against the knowledge you actually have.<br>
<br>
Act on nothing that is untested.<br>
<br>
Test your impressions.<br>
Test whether it belongs to the things in your control or not in your control.<br>
And if the latter, be prepared to respond, “It is nothing to me.”<br>
<br>
Step back and analyze your own senses, question their accuracy, and proceed only with the positive and constructive ones.<br>
Sure, it’s tempting to throw discipline and order to the wind and go with what feels right.<br>
But if your many youthful regrets are any indication, what feels right right now doesn’t always stand up well over time.<br>
<br>
Students claim to want to be taught but really secretly believe they already know everything.<br>
<br>
Who would reject the flood of fortune’s gifts?<br>
Anyone who has experienced how easily they flow back.<br>
<br>
Everything you do has a tax attached to it.<br>
For example, the tax on traveling is all the waiting around.<br>
Disagreements and occasional frustration are taxes placed on even the happiest of relationships.<br>
Theft is a tax on abundance and having things that other people want.<br>
Stress and problems are tariffs that come attached to success.<br>
Simply pay the taxes in life, and enjoy the fruits of what you get to keep.<br>
<br>
Do away with the opinion I am harmed, and the harm is cast away too.<br>
Do away with being harmed, and harm disappears.<br>
<br>
Set your mind upon things that are unquestionably good - wisdom, self-control, justice, courage.<br>
No one who achieves these quiet virtues experiences buyer’s remorse.<br>
<br>
When you let your attention slide for a bit, don’t think you will get back a grip on it whenever you wish.<br>
Instead, bear in mind that because of today’s mistake everything that follows will be necessarily worse.<br>
Be a person always stretching to avoid error, by never letting your attention slide.<br>
Letting your attention slip and wander builds bad habits and enables mistakes.<br>
<br>
Use cynical or contemptuous language as a way to dismantle some of the fanciest or most coveted parts of life.<br>
It will provide some much-needed objectivity.<br>
<br>
Feel free to change your mind - that’s what the mind is for.<br>
Live from one day to the next.<br>
If something strikes you as probable, say it.<br>
That is how you remain a free agent.<br>
A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.<br>
<br>
Turn it inside out and see what it is like - what it becomes like when old, sick, or prostituting itself.<br>
Situations are easier to understand from different perspectives.<br>
<br>
Indifference turns the highest power into no power.<br>
Looking at the beautiful expanse of the sky is an antidote to the nagging pettiness of earthly concerns.<br>
Lose yourself in that as often as you can.<br>
Adjust your preconceived notions of the rational and irrational in harmony with nature.<br>
<br>
Apply the rule of what is in keeping with one’s character.<br>
Question our own opinions.<br>
The more you subject them to the rigorous test of your education, the more you’ll be your own compass.<br>
<br>
Character is a powerful defense in a world that would love to be able to seduce you, buy you, tempt you, and change you.<br>
If you know what you believe and why you believe it, you’ll avoid poisonous relationships, toxic jobs, fair-weather friends, and any number of ills that afflict people who haven’t thought through their deepest concerns.<br>
<br>
First tell yourself what kind of person you want to be, what’s important to you, what your priorities are.<br>
Then do what you have to do. Work toward that and forsake all the others.<br>
<br>
If you wish to be beautiful, then work diligently at human excellence.<br>
If you want some good, get it from yourself.<br>
<br>
Where is Good? In your reasoned choices.<br>
Where is Evil? In your reasoned choices.<br>
Where is that which is neither Good nor Evil? In the things outside of your own reasoned choice.<br>
Not whether something is rewarded.<br>
Not whether something will succeed.<br>
Only whether it is the right choice.<br>
The right thing to do always comes from your reasoned choice.<br>
Ignore everything else. Focus only on your choices.<br>
<br>
You will only get one shot at today. You have only twenty-four hours with which to take it. And then it is gone and lost forever. Will you fully inhabit all of today?<br>
<br>
Your ancestors set up those trophies, not that you may gaze at them in wonder, but that you may also imitate the virtues of the men who set them up.<br>
<br>
Peace of mind is doing nothing wrong.<br>
Those who lack self-control live disoriented and disturbed lives.<br>
<br>
If you want to do something, make a habit of it.<br>
Take pleasure in taking the right actions - rather than the results.<br>
<br>
How you do anything is how you do everything.<br>
How you handle today is how you’ll handle every day.<br>
<br>
Don’t be satisfied with mere learning.<br>
Add practice and training.<br>
As time passes you forget what you learned.<br>
<br>
Read the few great books deeply instead of briefly skimming all the new books.<br>
<br>
Proper human work:<br>
* acts of kindness to other human beings<br>
* disdain for the stirrings of the senses<br>
* identifying trustworthy impressions<br>
* contemplating the natural order and all that happens in keeping with it.<br>
<br>
Don’t get upset. Do the right thing.<br>
<br>
Remember the purpose and principles you value most.<br>
<br>
Your progress can be impeded or disrupted, but the mind can always be reverted - it retains the power to redirect the path.<br>
<br>
Whenever talking about people, take a bird’s-eye view and see everything all at once: gatherings, armies, farms, weddings and divorces, births and deaths, noisy courtrooms or silent spaces, every foreign culture, holidays, memorials, markets - all blended together and arranged in a pairing of opposites.<br>
<br>
You can choose whose children you’d like to be.<br>
Great people have recorded their wisdom in books.<br>
Be the promising children of these noble parents.<br>
<br>
Focus on doing the smallest things well: practicing with full effort, mastering a specific task.<br>
Don’t worry about winning championships, or the opponent’s lead.<br>
<br>
Build up your life action by action.<br>
Be content if each one achieves its goal as far as possible.<br>
<br>
Every emotion is at first weak. Later it rouses itself and gathers strength as it moves along.<br>
It’s easier to slow it down than to supplant it.<br>
Rivers are easiest to cross at their source.<br>
<br>
Instead of, “Tell me what to do!”, a far better request is, “Train my mind to adapt to any circumstance.”<br>
Then if circumstances take you off script, you won’t be desperate for new advice.<br>
<br>
Manage expectations: consider both the best and worst case scenarios.<br>
<br>
Don’t just think about what you wish to happen, but also what very realistically can happen if things were to suddenly turn.<br>
<br>
Prepare for that to be exactly what they want to happen - it is an opportunity for excellence and virtue.<br>
<br>
Thinking of everything that lies ahead is usually counterproductive and overwhelming.<br>
Focus exclusively on the present to avoid or remove those intimidating or negative thoughts.<br>
<br>
Calm is contagious.<br>
<br>
Ask most people what they’re working toward: become a millionaire? get discovered? become famous?<br>
Ask “Why are you doing that?”: want freedom? want happiness? want the respect of their peers?<br>
<br>
You put immense effort and expense you put into chasing things that are simple and straightforward to acquire.<br>
It’s as if you prefer to spend years building a complicated machine instead of just reaching out and picking up what you want.<br>
Freedom? That’s easy. It’s in your choices.<br>
Happiness? That’s easy. It’s in your choices.<br>
All of that is right in front of you.<br>
No need to take the long way to get there.<br>
<br>
Paradoxical intention:<br>
If a patient couldn’t sleep, the standard therapy would be relaxation techniques.<br>
Frankl instead encouraged the patient to try not to fall asleep.<br>
He found that shifting focus off the problem deflected the patient’s obsessive attention away from it and allowed them to eventually sleep normally.<br>
<br>
CEO of Charles Schwab, when hiring, takes a candidate to breakfast and asks the restaurant’s manager to purposely mess up the candidate’s breakfast order.<br>
He’s testing to see how they react.<br>
<br>
Use negative circumstance as an opportunity to practice an unintended virtue or form of excellence.<br>
<br>
Never shirk the proper dispatch of your duty.<br>
Make the most of your resources to do well the duty at hand.<br>
<br>
Morality can be complicated - but the right thing is usually clear.<br>
<br>
Our duty is rarely easy, but it is important.<br>
It’s also usually the harder choice. But you must do it.<br>
<br>
Bring your will into harmony with whatever happens, so that nothing happens against your will and nothing that you wish for fails to happen.<br>
<br>
A TO-DO list seems burdensome, but a GET TO DO list sounds like a privilege.<br>
<br>
Don’t try to impose your will on the world.<br>
Instead see yourself as fortunate to receive and respond to the will in the world.<br>
<br>
Good people will do what they find honorable to do, even if it requires hard work.<br>
They won’t do what they find base, even if it brings wealth, pleasure, or power.<br>
Nothing will deter them from what is honorable, and nothing will lure them into what is base.<br>
<br>
Were you made for pleasure?<br>
To be coddled or to exert yourself?<br>
<br>
A good king is from the outset and by necessity a philosopher.<br>
Philosophy is essential in his role as a leader and warrior.<br>
Leadership offers an unending series of ethical decisions that require priorities, balance, and clarity.<br>
Either philosophers should become kings, or those now called kings should truly and sufficiently undertake philosophy.<br>
The philosopher is a kingly person.<br>
<br>
Philosophy cultivates your reason and ethics so that you can do your job well.<br>
Don’t just wing it.<br>
<br>
Love the humble art you have learned, making yourself neither a tyrant nor a slave to any person.<br>
<br>
Make the time.<br>
If you put in the effort, the rest will take care of itself.<br>
Love the craft, be a craftsman.<br>
Delight in attending to your own improvement, day by day.<br>
<br>
News can never be relevant to your reasoned choice.<br>
Can anyone break news to you that your assumptions or desires are wrong?<br>
No.<br>
<br>
Getting angry is a weakness.<br>
Be gentle with those who would obstruct your path or create other difficulties.<br>
Forgive them, for they know not what they do.<br>
<br>
You find yourself thinking, “Why can’t they just do things right?”<br>
But not everyone has had the advantages that you’ve had.<br>
You had a head start over some people.<br>
That’s why it is your duty to understand and be patient with others.<br>
<br>
No matter what happens today, shift to what lies within your reasoned choices.<br>
Ignore the distracting emotions that pop up.<br>
Don’t get emotional - get focused.<br>
<br>
The inexperienced and fearful talk to reassure themselves.<br>
The ability to listen, to deliberately keep out of a conversation and subsist without its validity, is rare.<br>
Silence is a way to build strength and self-sufficiency.<br>
<br>
Don’t tell yourself anything more than what the initial impressions report.<br>
You hear that someone is speaking badly about you, but not that you’ve been harmed.<br>
You hear your son is sick, but not that his life is at risk.<br>
Stay within your first impressions.<br>
Don’t add to them in your head.<br>
Stop, courageously, at the surface.<br>
See things in plain, objective form.<br>
<br>
Strength should not go against strength.<br>
Don’t try to beat your opponent where they are strongest.<br>
<br>
When you try to undertake some impossible task you haven’t bothered to think through.<br>
Or you let someone put you on the spot.<br>
Or you say yes to everything that comes your way.<br>
You are trying to play a losing game.<br>
<br>
The vast majority of your words and actions are unnecessary.<br>
Corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and tranquility.<br>
At each moment, ask if this is one of the unnecessary things.<br>
<br>
Endless pleasure becomes its own form of punishment.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of misfortunes one can practice, plenty of problems one can solve in advance.<br>
Don’t just think about these things, but live them.<br>
Do it now, while things are good.<br>
<br>
If you are already humble, no one will need to humble you.<br>
<br>
Proper training can change your default habits.<br>
Train yourself to avoid gossip, and you won’t get pulled into it.<br>
Train yourself on any habit, and you’ll be able to unconsciously go to that habit in trying times.<br>
<br>
Being unexpected adds to the weight of a disaster.<br>
For that reason, expect anything.<br>
In advance, think of all things that could actually happen.<br>
<br>
Make yourself invulnerable to your dependency on comfort and convenience, or one day your vulnerability might bring you to your knees.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your relaxation like a poet - not idly but actively, observing the world around you, taking it all in, better understanding your place in the universe.<br>
Don’t take a day off from learning.<br>
<br>
Money doesn’t change people, it just makes them more of who they are.<br>
<br>
Reflect on what you used to accept as normal.<br>
Consider your first paycheck - how big it seemed then.<br>
Remember your first apartment.<br>
Today, as you’ve become more successful, these conditions would hardly feel sufficient.<br>
You probably want even more than what you have right now.<br>
Yet just a few years ago those paltry conditions were not only enough, they felt great!<br>
When you become successful, you forget how strong you used to be.<br>
<br>
The work of living is to set standards and then not compromise them.<br>
<br>
Do good in this particular instance, right now.<br>
<br>
If you have to preface your remarks with indicators of honesty or directness, what does that say about everything else you say?<br>
If you say you’re being honest now, does that mean you usually aren’t?<br>
<br>
The best revenge is to exact no revenge at all.<br>
<br>
Even a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked.<br>
Yet if you’ve ever accidentally stepped on a dog, you know that the first reaction is usually a bark or a yelp or a quick snap of the jaws.<br>
In the instant, there is no distinction - just pain.<br>
<br>
A virtuous person is generous with assumptions: that something was an accident, that someone didn’t know, that it won’t happen again.<br>
<br>
A wolf should not befriend sheep.<br>
<br>
You could hope that goodness comes your way - good news, good weather, good luck.<br>
Or you could find it within your own thoughts, and make it with your own actions.<br>
<br>
Philosophy attracts introverts.<br>
<br>
Each person acquires their own character, but their official roles are designated by chance.<br>
Invite some (with other roles) to your table.<br>
<br>
Philosophy shouldn’t have to accept what time or energy is left over from other occupations.<br>
Instead, make time for those other pursuits only once your philosophy study is finished.<br>
<br>
If real self-improvement is what you’re after, don’t leave your reading until those few minutes before you shut off the lights and go to bed.<br>
<br>
There is hardly an idea in Stoic philosophy that wouldn’t be immediately agreeable to a child, or that doesn’t jibe with common sense.<br>
You were born with an attraction to virtue and self-mastery.<br>
If you’ve gotten far from that, it’s from a nurturing of the wrong things and the wrong ideas.<br>
Philosophy is a tool to strip it all away - to get back to your true nature.<br>
<br>
“Amor fati” = a love of fate = not just accepting, but loving everything that happens.<br>
<br>
“This man has conquered the world! What have you done?”<br>
“I have conquered the need to conquer the world.”<br>
<br>
To have a great empire, rule over yourself.<br>
<br>
Cease to hope and you will cease to fear.<br>
Hope and fear are the same.<br>
Both hope and fear contain a dangerous amount of want and worry in them.<br>
The want is what causes the worry.<br>
<br>
Adapting yourself to present circumstances.<br>
Don’t send out thoughts too far ahead - projections into the future about things you do not control.<br>
<br>
Let philosophy scrape off your own faults, not the faults of others.<br>
Leave other people to that task for themselves and their own journey.<br>
<br>
When you experience happiness or wisdom, don’t try to grab that moment and hold on to it with all your might.<br>
It’s not under your control how long it lasts.<br>
Enjoy it, recognize it, remember it.<br>
Having it for a moment is the same as having it forever.<br>
<br>
Luxury destroys both the body and the soul, causing weakness and incapacity in the body, and lack of control and cowardice in the soul.<br>
Luxury breeds injustice because it also breeds greediness.<br>
<br>
Always shun that which makes you angry.<br>
It’s not a sign of weakness to shut it out.<br>
Instead, it’s a sign of strong will.<br>
Remove this stimulus from your life.<br>
What follows is peace and serenity.<br>
<br>
Postpone nothing.<br>
Be like a dying person - as if you’ve come to the very end of life.<br>
Balance life’s books each day.<br>
The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.<br>
<br>
The number of people who stand ready to consume one’s time, to no purpose, is almost countless.<br>
No person hands out their money to passersby, but to how many do you hand out your life?<br>
You’re tight-fisted with property and money, yet think too little of wasting time: the one thing about which you should be a miser.<br>
