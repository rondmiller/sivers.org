<h1>What it means to be resourceful</h1>

</header>

<p>
	I was at a musicians’ gathering in Memphis.
	I met a lot of people complaining that their various forms of online distribution weren’t earning them as much as they’d hoped.
</p><p>
	Then I met a musician who sold 8000 copies of his album himself.
	No distributor.
	No website.
	Just by himself.
</p><p>
	I asked him how he did it.
	He said, “<strong>I just slowly drove around the city every night, with the windows down, playing my music loud. When I saw someone digging it, I’d go talk with them. I’d sell almost everyone a copy — about 20 or 30 a night. Been doing this about a year. Sold 8000 so far.</strong>”
</p><p>
	I love this story!
	It’s so direct!
	It hit me especially hard because all the musicians I’d met before him were complaining about how it’s impossible to make money anymore.
</p><p>
	It got me thinking about what it means to be resourceful.
</p><p>
	The succinct way to show it is to contrast two different mindsets.
	I’ll call them A and B.
</p><p>
	A: “I spent $60,000 making this album.”
<br/>
	B: “I spent $60 making this album.”
</p><p>
	A: “There are no good live music venues anymore!”
<br/>
	B: “I made us a new venue.”
</p><p>
	A: “I’ve tried everything.”
<br/>
	B: “I found a book from the 1970s with some unique ideas I’m applying to our marketing.”
</p><p>
	A: “I don’t have time to do it all!”
<br/>
	B: “Two of my fans help with promotion, one edits my videos, and one runs my website.”
</p><p>
	A: “I’m not some Hollywood networking dude. I don’t have connections in the industry.”
<br/>
	B: “My barber knew the promoter’s wife, so it took some persistence, but now we’re playing at his festival.”
</p><p>
	A: “They said we weren’t allowed to just show up.”
<br/>
	B: “We just showed up, and wouldn’t leave. Eventually they said OK.”
</p><p>
	A: “We didn’t get the festival gig.”
<br/>
	B: “They rejected us, so we contacted every artist at the festival until we found one that insisted the promoter book us as their opening act.”
</p><p>
	A: “There’s just no way!”
<br/>
	B: “I figured out a way.”
</p><p>
<strong>
	It means being creative, rebellious, determined, and unstoppable.
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>
	It means asking for help, but not waiting for help.
</strong>
