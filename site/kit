<p>
	When I was promoting myself as a musician, I noticed an interesting pattern.
	If I had a good conversation with somebody in the music business, then quite often they would send an opportunity my way within a day or two.
</p><p>
	In other words, when I look back at the random opportunities that came my way, they often came from someone who I had just spoken with a day or two before.
</p><p>
	Yes I just said this twice to emphasize it.
	This is important.
</p><p>
	Years later, when I was running CD Baby, various opportunities came up where someone asked me to recommend a musician.
	I almost always recommended whichever musician I had just spoken with, since they came to mind first.
	That’s why it’s so important to keep in touch.
</p><p>
	There were some amazing musicians whose music I loved, so I contacted them to tell them I’m a huge fan, and would love to help however I can.
	But if they didn’t keep in touch, they eventually fell out of my mind.
	It’s unfortunate, but that’s life.
</p><p>
	There were some good (but not amazing) musicians who were great at keeping in touch.
	So when opportunities came my way, guess who I thought of to recommend?
	Yep.
	That’s life.
</p><p>
<strong>
	The difference between success and failure can be as simple as keeping in touch. 
</strong>
</p><p>
	It takes effort to meet people.
	So once you’ve met someone, get the most out of the relationship for both of you.
	Keep in touch.
