<h1>Why I’m not on Facebook</h1>
<small>2018-03-21</small>

<p>
	I tried Facebook for a few weeks in 2007, but I hadn’t really used it since then.
	I would log in once a month for a few minutes and click [ACCEPT] to all the friend requests from strangers, then log out.
	I hit the 5000 friend-limit, so I created a second profile.
	That hit the 5000 friend-limit too, so I created a third.
	When the third one hit the friend-limit, I stopped.
</p><p>
	I thought I was just being polite, accepting friend requests, but I didn’t know who most of them were.
<strong>
	It was very insincere.
</strong>
	When real friends would ask if I’m on Facebook, I’d have to explain, “It looks like I’m there, but not really there.”
	I never posted anything personal, and never installed it on my phone.
	I was really just using it to announce new blog posts.
</p><p>
	When people would do their “<a href="https://deletefacebook.com/">DELETE FACEBOOK!</a>” campaigns, I didn’t bother because I wasn’t using it anyway.
<strong>
	It was causing me no harm.
</strong>
	I think it’s <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=facebook&amp;sites=calnewport.com&amp;ia=web">net-negative for the world, and causing many people harm</a>, but not me, so why bother deleting it?
</p><p>
<strong>
	But the more I thought about it, the less I liked my implied support.
</strong>
	I’m sick of being insincere.
	I’m against centralized platforms.
	I strongly prefer a <a href="https://indieweb.org/">decentralized internet</a>.
	I’m always helping friends get off of the big platforms and on to their own servers.
</p><p>
	Maybe the fact that I use Facebook to share my blog posts is a tiny tiny reason why others are still using it.
	It’s like I’m still visiting friends in the smoking area, even though I don’t smoke.
	Maybe if I quit going entirely, it will help my friends quit, too.
</p><p>
<strong>
	So I snapped out of the silly fear that people won’t find me if I’m not there.
</strong>
	If they care at all, they’ll find me.
</p><p>
	So, yeah.
	That decided it.
	I deleted all three accounts with 15,000 “friends”.
</p><p>
	I had a selfish business reason to keep it.
	I’m going to be publishing three different books over the next year, and plan to launch a new business, too.
<strong>
	But I’m willing to take that small loss in promotion, because <a href="http://blog.seanbonner.com/2012/04/15/on-leaving-facebook/">it’s the right thing to do</a>.
</strong>
	It always feels good to get rid of things I’m not using.
</p><p>
	I’ve been online since 1994.
	I remember when everyone thought mp3.com was everything, and a few years later it was gone.
	Then everyone thought MySpace was everything, and a few years later it was moot.
	Now it’s Facebook, Instagram, and Google, but eventually they’ll all be moot, too.
	It’s the natural cycle of things.
