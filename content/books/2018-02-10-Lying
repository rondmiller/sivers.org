TITLE: Lying - by Sam Harris
ISBN: 1940051002
RATING: 3
SUMMARY: A tiny booklet, like a long article, about why lying is bad. Not as many insights as I expected.
NOTES:
We often behave in ways that are guaranteed to make us unhappy.

To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication.

People lie so that others will form beliefs that are not true.

All forms of lying - including white lies meant to spare the feelings of others - are associated with less satisfying relationships.

Sincerity, authenticity, integrity, mutual understanding - these and other sources of moral wealth are destroyed the moment we deliberately misrepresent our beliefs.

Among the many corrosive effects of unjust laws: They tempt peaceful and (otherwise) honest people to lie so as to avoid being punished for behavior that is ethically blameless.

It is hard to abolish lies once they have escaped into the world.
We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed.

Peaceful, honest people have the right to be left alone.

I’d call it “skillful truth-telling” as opposed to “evasion.”

When you were doing all these charitable things, did you really care about the people you were doing these things for?

When you care, you’ll know what to do.
