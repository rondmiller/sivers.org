<h1>What I’m doing now</h1>
<p class="small"><em>
(This is <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">a now page</a>, and if you have your own site, <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">you should make one</a>, too.)

<h2>Oxford:</h2>
<p>
Soon I leave for Oxford, England, getting a taste of what it would be like to live there.
</p><p>
Because of this, my day-to-day “now” will be pretty unpredictable.
</p>

<h2>Writing:</h2>
<p>
My main focus: <strong>I’m writing three books this year:</strong>
</p><ol><li>
“<a href="/m">Your Music and People</a>” <em>(done)</em>
</li><li>
“<a href="/n">Hell Yeah or No</a>” <em>(<strong>doing now</strong>)</em>
</li><li>
“<a href="/h">How to Live</a>” <em>(rough draft done)</em>
</li></ol>
<p>
I plan to self-publish all of these.
Printing hard-cover books, hiring my own translators, illustrators and animators, and selling everything directly from my site.
It feels kinda like the independent music movement from 1999-2000 where musicians realized they weren’t beholden to record labels.
The idea of not being beholden to Amazon or publishers is exciting.
It might mean less income, but that’s worth it to me.
It’s more inspiring.
</p><p>
It’s also a fun programming challenge: building a database and site to manage translations, writing a script to turn my HTML articles into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epub">EPUB</a> format, and more.
</p><p>
I’ve been turning off my internet connection - actually powering off the modem - from 7pm until around noon the next day, so that I can write offline without temptation to research various things that pop into my mind.  It helps.
</p>


<h2>Translators:</h2>
<p>
Two months ago, I emailed <a href="/list">my private email list</a>, looking for translators to translate my next books into their language.  1500 answered and offered their help.  500 of them offered to do it for free.
</p><p>
So I built a crowd-source kind of translation web app, so many translators, reviewers, and editors can log in and translate my books into their language, sentence-by-sentence.
I’ll write about it later, when the first book is done.
</p><p>
Now 196 translators are translating my next book into 44 languages.
</p><p>
So it’s been a really intense few months, first building the app and now emailing with all the translators.
</p>


<h2>Health:</h2>
<p>
In the last few months, I’ve gone from 100kg (220lbs) to 80kg (178lbs).
It’s about the only time in my life I’ve ever lost weight. It feels great.
For my height (175cm) I should be about 70kg (155lbs). <a href="https://sivers.org/zipit">Kick my ass if I don’t</a>, OK?
</p>


<h2>No to everything else</h2>
<p>
(See <a href="/no2">“saying no to everything else”</a> for more thoughts on this.)
I still get requests to do public speaking and interviews and such, but I’m just enjoying staying focused inward on my writing and learning, instead of shallow crowd-pleasing.
</p><p>
I don’t want more money or more fame.
Just more focused learning and creative output.
