<!-- How to Live -->
<h1>How to Live</h1>

<p>
There's an amazing book called “<a href="/book/Sum">Sum</a>”, that has forty radically different, conflicting, and creative answers to the question “What happens when you die?”
</p><p>
Directly inspired by that, I've written a book that has twenty radically different, conflicting, and useful answers to the question of how to live.
</p><p>
It's extra-exciting and personal for me, because I realized that for over ten years, I've been writing for many hours a week on this subject for my own reflection.
</p><p>
Rough draft is finished (early 2018), and I'll be editing and improving it throughout 2018.
