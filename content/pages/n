	“We’re prepared to offer $22 million dollars,” he said over the phone.
</p><p>
	I said, “That sounds fair as long as it’s free and clear, and I don’t have to do anything for it.”
</p><p>
	And with that, I had a verbal agreement to sell my company, <a href="/a">my single focus of the last ten years</a>.
	The paperwork completed a few months later with a wire transfer.
</p><p>
	That $22 million was all mine, with no strings attached, since I had no investors and no debts.
	I didn't want or need it.
	I already had $4 million from running the business, so I’d already satisfied any shallow desires years ago.
</p><p>
	I was a youthful 37, no kids, no debts, a light-weight life with hardly any possessions, wasn’t tied to any location, and had recently broken up with my girlfriend.
<strong>
	And now I had signed a non-compete agreement that said I couldn’t do the one thing I’d been doing since I was 27.
</strong>
</p><p>
	So it got me thinking:
</p><p>
	What am I going to do next?<br>
	What should I do with $22 million dollars?<br>
	How can I be smart about this?<br>
	Based on what values?  Altruism?  Hedonism?  Conquest?  Legacy?  Personal growth?
</p><p>
	But what is personal growth, anyway?<br>
	Being more of who I already am, or re-defining myself into someone different?<br>
	Expanding my horizons, or narrowing my focus?
</p><p>
	It made me question everything.
</p><p>
	What do you do when you don’t have to do anything?<br>
	Where do you go when you don’t have to be anywhere?
</p><p>
	The next morning I woke up with a great idea for my next business.
	I called it Muckwork, got the domain name, incorporated a company, built the database, started programming it, and even announced it.
	But after a few months of building it, I realized that <strong>I had this great opportunity to make a real change in my life</strong>, but here I was doing the exact same thing I’d been doing for the last ten years — just a slightly different business. If I launched this, I’d be committing to many more years of the same.
</p><p>
	So those questions came back.
</p><p>
	What else could I be?<br>
	Where else could I be?<br>
	How can I make a real change?
</p><p>
<strong>
	For the next ten years, I wrote for hours a day in my private journal, asking myself questions and answering them.
</strong>
	Then often taking experimental and radical actions based on these thoughts.
</p><p>
<strong>
	The thoughts and experiences that seemed useful to others, I’d share <a href="/blog">on my website</a>, which are now collected here in this book for you.
</strong>
</p><p>
	I hope you find it useful.
