<!-- A curious answer to the most common question -->
<p>
	People will always and forever ask you, “What kind of music do you do?”
</p><p>
	You will always and forever have to answer that question.
	So have a good description prepared in advance.
</p><p>
	Many musicians avoid answering by saying, “We play all styles.”
	No you don’t.
	That’s like saying, “I speak all languages.”
</p><p>
	Many musicians avoid answering by saying, “We are totally unique.”
	No you’re not.
	If you use notes, instruments, beats, or words, you’re not <em>totally</em> unique.
</p><p>
<strong>
	If you give people a non-answer like this, you lose them.
</strong>
	You had the chance to make a fan, and you blew it.
	They won’t remember you because you gave them nothing to remember.
	You didn’t make them curious.
</p><p>
	Imagine if you had said, “We sound like the smell of fresh baked bread.”
</p><p>
	Or “We’re the soundtrack to the final battle to save the earth.”
</p><p>
	Or “Bob Marley with a Turkish pipe smoking Japanese candy.”
</p><p>
	Then you’ve got their interest!
	A creative description also suggests that your music will be creative, too.
</p><p>
<strong>
	So make up a curious answer to that common question.
</strong>
	You don’t have to feel limited by it.
	Notice that those three examples I gave could sound like anything.
	And that’s the point.
</p><p>
<strong>
	With one interesting phrase to describe your music, you can make total strangers wonder about you.
</strong>
</p><p>
	But whatever you do, stay away from the words “everything”, “nothing”, “all styles”, “totally unique”, and the other non-answer: “a mix of rock, pop, jazz, hip-hop, folk, reggae, blues, techno, and metal.”
