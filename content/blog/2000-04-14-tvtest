<!-- This is only a test. See what happens. -->
<p>
	In America in the 1970s, they would test the Emergency Broadcast System on TV, with a long “BEEEEEEEEEEP”.
	At the end, an announcer would say, “This is a test. This is only a test.”
</p><p>
	That phrase is burned into my brain.
	“This is a test. This is only a test.”
	It’s very useful to remember when pursuing your career.
</p><p>
	Everything usually feels so serious — like if you make one mistake, it’ll all end in disaster.
	But really everything you do is just a test: an experiment to <strong>see what happens</strong>.
</p><p>
	My favorite times in life started with a “see what happens” approach.
</p><p>
	Let’s see what happens if I run my vocals through my guitar pedals.
</p><p>
	Let’s see what happens if I invite that famous producer out to lunch.
</p><p>
	Let’s see what happens if I call that radio station to ask their advice.
</p><p>
<strong>
	It’s actually impossible to fail if your only mission was to see what happens!
</strong>
</p><p>
	“This is a test. This is only a test.”
	There is no downside.
	Try everything!
