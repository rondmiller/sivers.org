<!-- Stay in touch with hundreds of people. -->
<p>
	Every person you’ve ever met has the potential to help you.
</p><p>
	If you keep in touch and stay on their mind, there’s a good chance an opportunity will come your way.
	But if you don’t keep in touch, that potential is almost gone.
	Out of touch, out of mind.
</p><p>
<strong>
	So you need to make a simple automatic system to keep in touch without relying on your memory.
</strong>
	Use your database to label everyone in a category like this:
</p><ul><li>
<strong>
	A list:
</strong>
	Very important people.
	Contact every three weeks.
</li><li>
<strong>
	B list:
</strong>
	Important people.
	Contact every two months.
</li><li>
<strong>
	C list:
</strong>
	Most people.
	Contact every six months.
</li><li>
<strong>
	D list:
</strong>
	Demoted people.
	Contact once a year, to make sure you still have their correct info.
</li></ul>
<p>
	When you contact each person, just find out how they’re doing.
	See if you can help them in any way.
</p><p>
<strong>
	This regular contact should be unselfish, and sincerely caring how they are.
</strong>
	Don’t ask a favor unless you’ve been in touch recently.
	It’s a little insulting to contact someone you haven’t talked with in a long time, just to ask a favor.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Most people are so bad at keeping in touch that they will really appreciate you doing it.
</strong>
	And when you make this a habit, it’s easy to stay in touch with hundreds or thousands of people.
