<!-- Don’t try to sound big. -->
<p>
	When communicating with your fans and contacts, don’t try to sound bigger than you are.
</p><p>
	Don’t use the corporate “we”.
	Say “I”.
	Fans want to connect with you as a person, not as a brand.
</p><p>
	Don’t appear flawless.
	Show a charming flaw.
	Confidence attracts, but vulnerability endears.
</p><p>
	Definitely don’t use corporate-speak to try to sound like you’re a big business.
	It comes across as fake, insecure, or spam.
</p><p>
	Your fans are your friends.
	Speak to them like real people.
	Be weird.
<strong>
	Prove you’re a real person.
</strong>
	Write every post or email as if it was from you to your best friend.
</p><p>
	People have grown deaf to the bland language of big business.
	It all sounds like contrived posturing.
	It has no personality — no voice.
</p><p>
	This is one reason why it’s so much cooler to be small and independent instead of big and corporate.
</p><p>
	Being able to say “I” in your communication with fans is a great competitive advantage.
