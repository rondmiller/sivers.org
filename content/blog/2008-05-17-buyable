<!-- Don’t promote until people can take action. -->
<p>
	I often hear musicians say they want to do advance promotion — telling people about their new album before it’s available for purchase.
</p><p>
	Though the plan may be to generate excitement, I think the opposite happens.
	Imagine the dialogue.
</p><p>
	“Check out my new music!”
</p><p>
	“Where is it? Can I buy it?”
</p><p>
	“Not yet — but soon!”
</p><p>
	“Why are you telling me now?”
</p><p>
	“So you can be ready for the announcement!”
</p><p>
	(Then two months pass.)
</p><p>
	“Check out my new music! It’s ready!”
</p><p>
	“I think I already heard of this. Not new. Delete.”
</p><p>
	Instead, imagine this plan:
</p><ol><li>
	Record your music.
</li><li>
	Start conversations with the people who promote music.
	Don’t pitch them anything.
	Just get to know them.
</li><li>
	Prepare your marketing plan, but don’t do it yet.
	Just get everything into place.
</li><li>
	Get your music distributed everywhere.
	Before you announce it, make sure it’s actually there.
	Stream and even buy a copy, to make sure there were no mistakes.
</li><li>
	Finally, do your promotion, and tell everyone.
</li></ol>
<p>
	One of the nice things about crowd-funding is that for each project, there are two stages when people can take action, so you can repeat this cycle twice.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Never promote something until people can take action, or you might waste the one moment you had their attention.
