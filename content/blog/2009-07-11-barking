<!-- Barking -->
<p>
	I’m in New York City.
	Across the street is a man pacing on the sidewalk.
	He’s insanely barking something at the top of his lungs.
	Everyone is avoiding going anywhere near him.
</p><p>
	I get closer.
	I try to figure out what he’s screaming about.
	Finally I hear it.
	“20% coupons for window shades! 20% off! Window shades! Get your coupons here!”
</p><p>
	Yeah… uh… that’s not working.
</p><p>
	A week later, I’m hanging with a friend in Union Square.
	The whole time we’re talking, there’s some man yelling in the background.
	It’s almost like he’s singing a repetitive phrase — always an F falling to a D.
	Again I’m curious, so I get closer to hear what he’s yelling.
	“Help feed the homeless! Help feed the homeless!”
</p><p>
	Ah!
	So he’s trying to help!
	But again, everyone is avoiding him.
</p><p>
	Then it made me think:
<strong>
	How many of us do this?
</strong>
</p><p>
	Maybe we weren’t getting the results we wanted, so we thought if we shouted louder, more people would hear.
</p><p>
	But people avoid those types.
	If someone always pitches his business to friends at parties, he won’t get invited to parties anymore.
</p><p>
	In England, I heard the word “barking” used as slang for “insane”.
	(It’s short for “barking mad”, get it?)
</p><p>
	When promoting, make sure you’re not barking.
</p><p><strong>
	When things aren’t working, be smarter, not louder.
