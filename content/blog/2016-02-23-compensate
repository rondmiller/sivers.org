<!-- Over-compensate to compensate -->
<p>
	You have something you want to change: a thought process or habit you want to fix.
</p><p>
	Let’s use the metaphor of a bunch of bricks on a seesaw.
	Right now all the bricks are stacked on one side.
	This is the way you have been.
</p>

<p>
	To make a change, <strong>most people don’t do enough.</strong>
</p><p>
	If you do something small and sensible, it’s like moving one brick to the other site.
	You’re still unbalanced.
</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/compensate-l1.jpg">
<p>
	You think you made the change, but it’s not accounting for:
</p><ul><li>
	a lifetime of doing it the other way
</li><li>
	your environment that made you that way
</li><li>
	the pressure from friends to stay that way
</li><li>
	and the undertow of old habits.
</li></ul><p>
<strong>
	To make a change, you have to be extreme.
</strong>
	Go all the way the other way.
	<strong>It will feel like over-compensating</strong>, but you have to stack a huge pile of bricks on the other side.
</p>

<p>
	This new you sounds extreme and exciting.
	You will think you’re going to be completely changed.
</p><p>
	But actually the old stuff is still there.
	So really this is what you needed to do to balance, to compensate for that cultural baggage, self-identity, habit, and history.
</p>

<p>
	Once balanced, it will sink in, and become your new normal.
