<!-- Test marketing -->
<p>
	If you want a bigger company to help you some day, imitate what food companies call “test marketing”.
</p><p>
<strong>
	When companies create a new product, before they try to release it to the world, they want more proof that it will be a success.
</strong>
</p><p>
	So first they’ll release it only in a small city like Albany.
	They ask customers for feedback, then make improvements based on that.
<strong>
	They repeat this process until it’s a local hit.
</strong>
	Then they test it in a few more small cities until it’s a local hit there, too.
</p><p>
	Only after it’s a proven success do they get the financial backing to release it to the world.
	The investors are confident because it was a hit in all the test markets.
</p><p>
	So think of what you’re doing with your music as test marketing.
</p><p>
	Whether you use a physical location or a virtual community, test it somewhere small first.
	Ask people for feedback, then make improvements based on that.
	Repeat this process until it’s a local hit.
	Then test it in a few more places until it’s a hit there, too.
</p><p>
	Show this proof to a big company, so they can confidently invest and release it to the world.
