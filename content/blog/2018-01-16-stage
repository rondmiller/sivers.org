<!-- It’s hard to get off stage. -->
<p>
	Being a songwriter is weird.
	You dig deep inside yourself.
	You extract and explain your emotions.
	Then you broadcast your innermost feelings to the biggest possible audience.
</p><p>
	It’s a life that demands a deep focus on yourself.
	It’s all you, you, you.
	It’s a one-way road that goes from inside of you out to the audience.
</p><p>
	Because of this, it’s hard for you to turn that off, switch directions, and just listen to others.
</p><p>
<strong>
	The essence of marketing is looking at everything from the other person’s point of view.
</strong>
	So it’s no surprise that musicians find it hard to switch into that mode.
</p><p>
	It’s OK.
	Have some compassion for your situation.
	It’s a side-effect of the craft.
	Don’t beat yourself up over it.
</p><p>
	But first, before you begin marketing, get off the stage.
	Pause your habit of broadcasting.
	Turn the spotlight on your audience.
	And get ready to listen.
