<!-- Was 10%, now 90% -->
<p>
	A few decades ago, as a musician, only 10% of your career was up to you.
</p><p>
	A few gate-keepers controlled all the outlets.
	You had to impress one of these powerful people to be allowed to present your music to the world.
	So getting discovered was about all you could do.
</p><p>
<strong>
	But now 90% of your career is up to you.
</strong>
	You have all the tools to make it happen.
</p><p>
	You have to come up with a plan and make it happen.
	You have to make a great recording, a great show, a great video.
	You have to make thousands of people want your music so much they are willing to pay for it.
</p><p>
	Record labels aren’t guessing anymore.
	They’re only signing artists that have built a success on their own.
	And even if a record label signs you, it’s still up to you to make people want it!
</p><p>
<strong>
	The only thing stopping you from great success is yourself.
</strong>
	This is both scary and exciting.
	But at least you’re in control.
