<!-- Be an extreme character. -->
<p>
	This is both fun and considerate.
</p><p>
	When people say that a movie has a great character, they mean it was someone especially shocking, funny, or honest.
	To be a great entertainer, you need to be larger than life.
</p><p>
	Push your outer boundaries.
	Show your weirdness.
	Bring out all your quirks.
	The world needs that.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Your public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme character.
</strong>
	It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.
	(It’s easier to be honest behind a mask.)
</p><p>
	Some of the biggest musicians of the last few decades have admitted they were playing a character.
	Eminem, for example, said he wrote lyrics with the goal of shocking a passive listener into paying attention.
	Then he built his public persona to match the lyrics.
</p><p>
	Are you concerned that maybe you should play it safe, because your music isn’t so extreme?
	Well… 
	Think of the conservative, old-fashioned performers that your great-grandmother probably liked.
Frank Sinatra.
Judy Garland.
Miles Davis.
Billie Holiday.
	Even these old legends were rather extreme.
</p><p>
<strong>
	It’s more interesting for the audience if you’re the opposite of normal.
</strong>
	So be an extreme character.
	The spotlight is the excuse.
	You can get away with anything in the name of entertainment.
