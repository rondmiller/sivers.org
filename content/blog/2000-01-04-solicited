<!-- How to get through the gates? -->
<p>
	As a young musician, I always heard that you had to get your music “solicited” to the major labels.
</p><p>
	I never really understood what “solicited” meant, until I worked on the inside.
	Here’s how it actually looks:
</p><p>
	Every day, tons of music is sent to the labels from total strangers.
	It’s just too much to deal with, so it’s all ignored.
	All of it.
</p><p>
<strong>
	These companies don’t exist to find new music.
	Their job is to profit from their existing artists.
</strong>
	That’s a huge job, in itself.
</p><p>
	When the manager or lawyer or producer of one of their artists comes in for a meeting, he’ll say, “I’m working with this new artist that you need to hear before we head out for lunch.”
	Then the executive will sit and give it a real listen.
</p><p>
	And that’s how you get heard.
<strong>
	That’s what “solicited” means.
</strong>
</p><p>
	When you send your music unsolicited to some company, you won’t get a real listen.
	Their lack of response says, “Sorry. You don’t get it. That’s not the way in.”
</p><p>
<strong>
	Do your research to find those managers, lawyers, agents, and producers that are already in.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Same thing goes for approaching any too-public target, whether it’s a celebrity, or major media outlet, or whatever.
<strong>
	Getting “solicited” through an existing contact is the best way to get through the gates.
</strong>
</p><p>
	You have to see it from their point of view.
	Understand what it’s like to be overwhelmed with new music.
	All they can handle is the stuff that’s been pre-approved by their trusted contacts.
