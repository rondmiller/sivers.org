<!-- If you target sharp enough, you will own your niche. -->
<p>
	Let’s say you’ve decided that your style of music should be proudly called “power-pop”.
</p><p>
	If you say, “We’re power-pop!” in the very first sentence or paragraph all of your marketing.
	If your email address is “powerpop@gmail.com”
	If your album title is “Powerpop Drip and Drop”
	If the license plate on your band van is “POWRPOP”
</p><p>
	When someone asks me for a music recommendation and says they like power-pop, guess who I’m going to tell them to buy?
</p><p><strong>
	Have the confidence to find your niche, define who you are, then declare it again and again and again and again.
</strong></p><p>
	If you do it persistently enough, you will own that niche.
	People will not be able to imagine that niche without you.
</p><p>
	Don’t forget you can <strong>use your city or country</strong> as a niche!
	Amplify your regional influence on your genre of music, and declare it to be an official sub-genre, of which you’re the originator.
	Think of past examples: Minneapolis funk, Seattle grunge, Korean K-pop, Icelandic avant-garde, and of course the different kinds of hip hop from every corner of the world.
</p><p>
	You can <strong>make your own niche</strong>, if you’re brave.
	You might be the best “a capella medieval metal” artist in the world.
