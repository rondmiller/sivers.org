<!-- You need to be profitable to last. -->
<p>
	A musician sent me her album, and very proudly said, “This cost $80,000 to make and two years to record. Everything is top-notch. We used one of the finest studios in the world.”
</p><p>
	She wanted me to be impressed, but once she said “$80,000” I lost hope in her ability to make a living making music.
</p><p>
	I’d be much more impressed with someone who could make an album for $800, because that shows they are resourceful.
	They could record a hundred albums for the price of hers!
	If I was an investor, I’d invest in that kind of person.
</p><p>
	Great music isn’t enough.
	Losing money can’t last.
<strong>
	For a career to be sustainable, it has to be profitable.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Don’t impress people with how much you spend.
<strong>
	Impress people with how little you spend.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Same goes for expensive tools.
	The audience can’t hear the difference between cheap and expensive equipment.
	So saying you need a certain tool is just another excuse to avoid the real work.
	The more talented somebody is, the less they need the props.
</p><p>
	Your ability to be resourceful diminishes over time.
	You get older and feel you’ve earned the comforts.
	So especially early in your career, be as resourceful as possible.
<strong>
	It shows you can survive.
