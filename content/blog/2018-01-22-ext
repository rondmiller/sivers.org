<!-- Art doesn’t end at the edge of the canvas. -->
<p>
	Imagine you see a caged feather on a museum wall.
	The sign underneath says the artist is a political activist in jail.
</p><p>
	Imagine that same caged feather again.
	But instead the sign says the artist is a high school kid in Florida.
</p><p>
	Or imagine that the only way to see it is to crawl deep into a shrinking tunnel that opens into a room of mirrors, where the caged feather is suspended by a thread.
</p><p>
	Same feather.
	Very different perceptions.
</p><p><strong>
	The way you present your art, and what people know about it, completely changes how they perceive it.
</strong></p><p>
	Therefore, your art doesn’t end at the edge of the canvas.
	Your creative decisions continue all the way to the end.
</p><p>
	Now think of the way you create and release music:
</p><ul><li>
	You have a tiny idea for a song.
</li><li>
	You flesh it out into a full song.
</li><li>
	You give it layers of instruments.
</li><li>
	You choose its texture when recording.
</li><li>
	You come up with an album title, and the visual look of your photos and videos.
</li></ul><p>
	Every step so far has been a creative expansion of your original idea.
</p><p>
	So now it’s time to put it out into the world.
<strong>
	Do you turn off all that creativity?
</strong>
	Just upload the song to the usual places, and announce it like everyone else?
</p><p>
	No!
	Your creative process hasn’t stopped!
	Flaunt your artistic freedoms, and have some fun with it!
</p><ul><li>
	the way you communicate with the world
</li><li>
	how you make your music available
</li><li>
	the stories you tell about your music and yourself
</li></ul><p>
	These are all the continuation of your creation.
</p><p><strong>
	Marketing is the final extension of your art.
