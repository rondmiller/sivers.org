<!-- Constantly ask what they really want. -->
<p>
	This may sound obvious, but for me it made all the difference.
</p><p>
	Before I interact with people, I ask myself this question:
	“What do they really want?”
</p><p>
	Like if I’m writing someone an email, I ask, “Why are they really reading this email?”
</p><p>
	If I’m contacting an agent, I ask, “Why are they really doing this job?”
</p><p>
	If I’m about to perform a show, I ask, “What are they really hoping to get from a night out at a concert?”
</p><p>
<strong>
	Thinking of everything from the other person’s point of view is one of the best things you can do in life.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Be what they want.
	And maybe they’ll be what you want, too.
