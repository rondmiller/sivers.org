<!-- People search harder for the obscure. -->
<p>
	On CD Baby, there was a great musician who made an amazing progressive heavy metal album.
</p><p>
	When we had a “search keywords” section, asking for three artists he sounds like, he just wrote the biggest-selling pop acts of that time (“Britney Spears, Ricky Martin, Backstreet Boys”).
</p><p>
	What the hell was he thinking?
	He just wanted to turn up in people’s search engines, at any cost.
	But for what?
	And who?
</p><p>
	Did he really want a Britney Spears fan to get tricked into finding his dark progressive metal album?
	Would that pre-teen actually spend the time to listen to his ten-minute epic called “Confusing Mysteries of Hell”?
</p><p>
	I suggested he instead have the confidence to target the real fans of his music.
</p><p>
	So he put three obscure progressive metal artists into his search engine description.
	(“Fates Warning, Shadow Gallery, Angra”)
</p><p>
	And guess what?
	He sold more music than ever!
	People searching for these obscure artists found only him.
	He found his true fans.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Fans of the obscure niches search harder for it.
	Make sure they can find you.
</strong>
	You want the passionate fans of your niche, not the casual fans of mainstream.
