<!-- Repeatedly follow-up to show you care. -->
<p>
	I knew a music publicist in New York City when she was at the peak of her success.
	A few of her clients had hits, so everyone wanted to work with her.
	She was flooded with new music.
</p><p>
	Here’s how she dealt with the flood:
</p><p>
	Whenever someone sent their music, it would go into an inbox.
	That inbox was completely ignored.
</p><p>
	Whenever someone contacted her to follow-up the first time, to ask if she’d received it, she would take their music out of that first inbox, and put it in a second inbox.
	That second inbox was also ignored.
</p><p>
	Then if they followed-up with her a second time, asking again if she’d had the chance to listen, she would take their music out of the second inbox, and put it in a third inbox.
	That third inbox would get a listen if she had some spare time.
</p><p>
	Finally, if they followed-up a third time, she would take their music out of the third inbox, and make it a priority to give it a real listen.
</p><p>
	She saw the shocked look on my face, as she described her system.
	So she explained:
</p><p>
<strong>
	“I can’t listen to everyone, so I can’t know who’s got the best music.
	But the ones who follow-up show they’ve got the tenacity and drive to succeed.
	As long as their music is also good, then those are the ones I want to work with.”
</strong>
</p><p>
	It wasn’t ego.
	It was just a practical way to deal with a flood, and a pretty good filter for choosing new clients.
</p><p>
	Maybe nobody else has an official system like this.
	But un-officially, they do.
<strong>
	Overwhelmed people don’t have time for all the random first-contacts.
</strong>
	Patience and persistence separate you from the rest, and show how much you care.
