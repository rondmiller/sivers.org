<!-- You don’t need confidence, just contribution. -->
<p>
	Years ago, I was so confident, and so naive.
	I was so sure that I was right and everyone else was wrong.
</p><p>
	Unfortunately I was lucky and <a href="/a">got successful</a>, so that kept me ignorant of my shortcomings.
</p><p>
	I <a href="/done">sold my company</a>, felt ready to do something new, and started to <a href="/book">learn</a>.
	But the more I learned, the more I realized how little I knew, and how dumb-lucky I had been.
</p><p>
	I continued learning until I felt like an absolute idiot.
	By then I was paralyzed, unable to create anything new.
</p><p>
	I’d <a href="/projects">start to make things</a>, but then see how stupid they revealed me to be, so I’d stop.
	I lost all confidence.
	I spent a few years completely stuck.
</p><p>
	Eventually, some new thoughts helped:
</p><ul><li>
<strong>
	Learning without doing is wasted.
</strong>
	If I don’t use what I learn, then it was pointless!
	How horrible to waste those hundreds of hours I spent learning, and not turn it into action.
	Like throwing good food in the trash: it’s morally wrong.
</li><li>
<strong>
<a href="/you-not-them">
	This isn’t about me.
</a>
</strong>
	How I feel in this moment doesn’t matter — it will pass.
	Nobody is judging me, because nobody is thinking of me.
	They are just looking for things to improve their own life.
	<a href="/publicu">The public me is not the real me</a> anyway, so if they judge my public persona, that’s fine.
</li><li>
<strong>
	The work is the point, and my work is unique.
</strong>
	If I can do something that people find useful, then I should.
	It doesn’t matter if it’s a masterpiece or not, as long as I enjoy it.
	I’ve got my own weird angle on things that’s <a href="/counter">a useful counter-melody</a> in the big orchestra of life.
</li></ul><p>
	So I’m glad my old confidence is gone, because it thought I was right, and maybe even great.
	But I quit that contest.
</p><p>
	Now I aim to make my work — my little contribution to the world — just unique and useful.
