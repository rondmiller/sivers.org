<!-- Shine a spotlight on one idea at a time. -->
<p>
	Writing in this format of short little articles has been really rewarding.
</p><p>
	I present one little idea, something you can read in under two minutes, and shine a spotlight on it.
</p><p>
	If it’s well-received, I’ll see it tweeted, linked-to, forwarded, and shared on forums.
</p><p>
	The comments always improve upon it, making me see new perspectives, or how I could have communicated it better.
</p><p>
	I’m usually surprised by which ones get a reaction.
	Something <a href="/obvious">obvious to me</a> may be powerful to others.
	Something powerful to me may be obvious to others.
</p><p>
<strong>
	But each idea gets its chance in the spotlight.
</strong>
</p><p>
	The work it takes to present it clearly and succinctly is rewarded, because it’s:
</p>
<ul><li>
	easier to communicate
</li><li>
	easier to explain to others
</li><li>
	more likely to be read, instead of someone saying, “Too long, I’ll come back later,” never to return.
</li></ul>
<p>
	When I’ve written articles that were too long or had too many ideas, they didn’t get much of a reaction.
</p><p>
<strong>
	When I read books, I often feel bad for the brilliant idea buried on page 217.
	How many people will read that?
</strong>
</p><p>
	Stop the orchestra.
	Solo that motif.
	Repeat it.
	Let the other instruments build upon it.
</p><p>
	Present a single idea, one at a time, and let others build upon it.
