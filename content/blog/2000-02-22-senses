<!-- Touch as many of their senses as you can. -->
<p>
	The more senses you touch in someone, the more they’ll remember you.
</p><p>
	The most sensory experience is a live show, with you sweating in front of them, the sound system pounding their chest, the flashing lights, the smell of the stinky club, and the visceral feeling of pushing up against strangers.
</p><p>
	The least sensory experience is an email or a plain web page.
</p><p>
	Reach as many senses as possible.
</p><ul><li>
	Have some great photos that you use next to any text.
</li><li>
	Make a video for every song.
</li><li>
	Be a guest on every video-show you can.
</li><li>
	At your live shows, burn incense or hug every person there, or…
</li></ul><p>
	You get the idea.
<strong>
	Keep aiming for the most sensory way to reach your audience.
