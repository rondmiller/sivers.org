<!-- Some quick context for these stories -->
<p>
	This book is entirely about you and your music.
	But I use some of my stories as examples.
	So here’s my context, as short as can be, to set the stage for the book.
</p><p>
	Since I was 14, all I wanted was to be a successful musician.
</p><p>
	First I graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston.
</p><p>
	Then I got a job at Warner/Chappell Music Publishing in New York City.
	There I learned a ton about how the traditional music industry works.
	I’ll tell you about that soon.
</p><p>
	Then I quit my job and became a full-time professional musician.
	I played over a thousand shows of all types.
	I was also a session guitarist and side-man, then I ran a recording studio, booking agency, record label, and more.
</p><p>
	I made a website to sell my CD, then my musician friends asked if I could sell their CD too.
	So I called it CD Baby, and it soon became the largest seller of independent music online.
	Over 150,000 musicians sold their music directly through me.
	(I have a different book about that, called “<a href="/a">Anything You Want</a>”.)
</p><p>
	I started to see the music business from the other side.
	I found out what it was like to be on the receiving end of musicians’ music.
	I became friends with successful people inside the music industry, and heard their perspective.
</p><p>
	I saw thousands of musicians succeed.
	So I paid attention to how they did it.
</p><p>
	That’s when I started writing my observations in this book.
	I felt like a spy, giving you the report from the inside, telling you how to get in.
</p><p>
	Now listen up, and I’ll tell you everything I know.
