<!-- Persistence is polite. -->
<p>
	As teenagers, we learned the hard way that if you contact someone and they don’t reply, they’re just not into you.
	If you keep trying, you must be a total loser.
</p><p>
	But in the business world, it’s the opposite.
<strong>
	If you don’t keep trying, you’re a loser!
</strong>
</p><p>
	If someone doesn’t get back to you, it probably wasn’t intentional.
	Everyone is busy, and their situation has nothing to do with you.
</p><p>
	Imagine two different scenarios:
</p><ol><li>
	Someone doesn’t reply, so you get upset and decide they’re evil and clearly meant to insult you.
	You resent them for life, and speak poorly of them forever.
</li><li>
	Someone doesn’t reply, so you assume they must be swamped in work.
	You wait a week, and contact them again.
	If still no reply, you feel sympathy that they must be really overwhelmed.
	You wait a week, and try again.
	If still no reply, you try to reach them a different way.
</li></ol><p>
<strong>
	Now, which one was rude, and which one was polite?
