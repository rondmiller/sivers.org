<!-- When you’re extremely unmotivated -->
<p>
	Like everyone, I get those times when I’m unmotivated to do anything.
	Brain dead.
	No energy.
	Everything feels like, “Why bother? What’s the point?”
</p><p>
	But I’ve finally figured out what to do with those times.
</p><p>
	Like everyone, I have a list of boring things that really need doing, but I’ve been putting off for years.
	I never do them because <strong>I’m always more excited about something else</strong>.
</p><p>
	So during my last unmotivated funk, I realized that because nothing is exciting me, that means nothing is exciting me more than this boring necessary stuff.
	And since I don’t want to waste my inspired times on brainless work, this is a perfect time to do them.
</p><p>
	So I made a list of these necessary things.
	I grumble and complain, but I use some caffeine, and get through them.
	It actually feels pretty good.
</p><p>
	Conventional wisdom tells us to do the important and difficult thing first.
	But doing this boring work moves me from a state of doing nothing to doing something.
	It makes me feel like doing something important again.
</p><p>
	So next time you’re feeling extremely unmotivated, do those things you never want to do anyway.
