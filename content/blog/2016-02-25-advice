<!-- Beware of advice -->
<p>
	Imagine you hand a man your camera, and ask him to take a photo of you.
</p><p>
	He does, but when you look at the photo later, you notice he took a photo of himself by mistake.
</p><p>
	Imagine you’ve got a question: “Should I quit my job, and start my own company?”
</p><p>
	You go ask the advice of some successful people you respect.
	Two say yes.
	Two say no.
</p><p>
	Because they can’t know everything about you and your unique situation, they’ll give advice that’s really just <strong>a reflection of their own current situation.</strong>
	So let’s look at <strong>some ways that advice is biased.</strong>
</p><h3>
	Lottery numbers
</h3><p>
	When successful people give advice, I usually hear it like this:
</p><p>
	“Here are the lottery numbers I played: 14 29 71 33 8.  They worked for me!”
</p><p>
	Success is based on so many factors.
	Some are luck.
	Some are not.
	It’s hard to know which are which.
</p><p>
	So which do you learn from?
</p><h3>
	Underdog opinion in their context
</h3><p>
	Someone giving advice doesn’t want to say what seems said too much already.
</p><p>
	But he’s basing that on his own surroundings, not yours.
</p><p>
	So if everyone around him is quitting their jobs, his advice to you would be to keep your job.
</p><p>
	That advice has nothing to do with what’s best for you — just what opinion seemed under-represented in his environment that day.
</p><h3>
	Creative sparks
</h3><p>
	You ask, “What should I do, option A or B?”
</p><p>
	He replies, “Zebra!”
</p><p>
	He’s treating it as brainstorming, giving a crazy suggestion just to open up <a href="/options">more options</a>.
</p><p>
	Like an <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=oscar+wilde+quotes">Oscar Wilde quip</a>, it was meant to be mostly entertaining, somewhat useful, and probably not correct.
</p><h3>
	So, what to do?
</h3><p>
	The problem is taking any one person’s advice too seriously.
</p><p>
	Ideally, asking advice should be like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_echolocation">echolocation</a>.
	Bounce ideas off of all of your surroundings, and listen to all the echoes to get the whole picture.
</p><p>
	<strong>Ultimately, only you know what to do</strong>, based on all the feedback you’ve received, and all your personal nuances that no one else knows.
