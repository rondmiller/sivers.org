<!-- Selling music by solving a specific need -->
<p>
	Instrumental music sells best if you tie it into a purpose.
</p><p>
	Massage music sells very well.
</p><p>
	Yoga music sells very well.
</p><p>
	Instrumental Christmas music sells very well. 
</p><p>
	Notice they’re selling more than just the music itself.
	They’re selling something that non-music people find useful.
<strong>
	They solve a problem.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Imagine two candlemakers.
</p><p>
	One says, “My candles have only the finest wax with the best quality wick!”
</p><p>
	The other says, “These are prayer candles. Light one whenever you pray.”
</p><p>
	There are dozens of people who will buy the first. 
</p><p>
	But there are millions who will buy the second.
