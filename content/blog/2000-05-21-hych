<!-- Always think how you can help someone. -->
<p>
	When someone says they’re looking for something, remember it, and help them find it.
	Introduce people to each other.
</p><p>
	Also listen carefully for what they might not realize they need.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Ask them what’s the hardest part about their job.
</strong>
	People love to complain.
	And each complaint gives you an idea about how you could help.
</p><p>
	When you come across something that might be useful, go through the list of everyone you know, and think if it’s particularly useful to that person.
	If so, contact them personally to tell them about it.
	Not a mass blast, but a real just-to-you recommendation.
	That’s much more meaningful because it shows you were thinking of them in particular.
</p><p>
	There’s always a favor you can do.
<strong>
	Give give give, and sometimes you will receive.
</strong>
