<!-- Never wait. -->
<p>
	One of the top music industry lawyers in Los Angeles was speaking at a conference.
</p><p>
	She’s an expert in copyright law, so someone asked her advice on a licensing problem.
	They had recorded their version of a famous song, but were unable to get the rights to sell it because they couldn’t get a response from the publisher.
</p><p>
	The lawyer shocked the audience when she said, “Sell it anyway.
<strong>
	Don’t wait for permission.
</strong>
	Save the proof that you tried your best to reach them.
	If they contact you to ask for money some day, pay them then.
	But never wait.”
</p><p>
	Coming from a copyright lawyer, that was a bold statement.
</p><p>
	It was a reminder that your career is more important than its details.
</p><p>
	Success is your top priority.
<strong>
	Never let anything stop you.
