<!-- Without a good reason, they won’t bother. -->
<p>
	Someone sees you carrying a guitar and asks, “What kind of music do you play?”
</p><p>
	You say, “There’s no way to describe it. You just have to check it out. We’re playing next Thursday night at 11. You should come.”
</p><p>
<strong>
	Imagine reversing the situation:
</strong>
</p><p>
	You meet a man that says he’s running a small business.
</p><p>
	You ask what his company does.
	He says, “There’s no way to describe it. You just have to check it out. We’re open next Thursday for just one hour. You should come.”
</p><p>
	Would you really bother to go check out his business if he couldn’t even tell you why you should?
	Of course not!
</p><p>
	So how do you expect anyone to come hear you play?
</p><p>
	You have to give people a good reason!
	Say a few words to make them curious.
</p><p>
<strong>
	When they ask what kind of music you do, they’re actively hoping you’ll give them a reason to care.
</strong>
</p><p>
	If you don’t give them a reason in that very moment, the opportunity is gone.
