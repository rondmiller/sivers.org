<!-- Pricing philosophy -->
<p>
	For years I made a living playing at universities.
</p><p>
	One time a college far away in Ohio — about a 12-hour drive — asked what I would charge to do a <strong>two-hour show</strong>.
</p><p>
	I said, “$1500”.
</p><p>
	She said, “Oh, that’s a bit too much. What would you charge to do just a <strong>one-hour show</strong>?”
</p><p>
	I said, “$2000”.
</p><p>
	She said, “No, wait, you’ll be performing less, not more!”
</p><p>
	I said, “Yeah! Exactly! What you’re paying me for is to get there! Once I’m there, playing music is the fun part! If you tell me I have to get back in the van and drive home after only an hour, then I’m going to charge you more than if you let me play for a couple hours first.”
</p><p>
	She liked that so much that she came up with the $1500.
</p><p>
	Point is:
	Business is creative.
	You can do things any way you want.
	There’s no need to adhere to norms.
	Norms are for businesses without personality.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Pour your personality and philosophy into the way you do business.
</strong>
	People actually appreciate it when you do things in a surprising way.
	It shows you care more than most — that you’re putting your self into this — that you’re not just in it for the money.
