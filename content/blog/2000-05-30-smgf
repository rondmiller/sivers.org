<!-- Small gifts go a long way. -->
<p>
	When I worked at Warner/Chappell, I was the least-important person in the company, just working in the library.
</p><p>
	Since it’s the largest music publisher in the world, I dealt with hundreds of people.
	I can’t remember most of their names.
	But three times, and only three times, I got a surprise gift from one of our songwriters.
</p><ol><li>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bongos">James Mastro</a>, from The Bongos, got me a cool little “Mother Mary” keychain when he toured Spain.
</li><li>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_DeVeaux">Gerry DeVeaux</a>, the multi-platinum dance writer, got me some funky plastic fish Christmas ornaments when he went to the Bahamas.
</li><li>
	And <a href="http://www.janekellywilliams.com/">Jane Kelly Williams</a> got me a red sweatshirt.
</li></ol><p>
	Can you believe I remember these details twenty years later?
	Believe it!
</p><p>
<strong>
	If any of these three people asked me for a favor, I’d be sure to help them out.
</strong>
</p><p>
	As you climb the ladder of success, giving a gift may go a long way and be remembered for years.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Get presents for the people you’ve met that are probably under-appreciated.
</strong>
	Don’t waste gifts on the high-power people.
	They already receive too many.
</p><p>
	Be generous.
	You’re going to see the same faces for years to come.
