<!-- The challenge: Don’t speak in future tense. -->
<p>
	When I lived in Los Angeles, I noticed they have a strange speaking pattern.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Everyone speaks in future tense.
</strong>
</p><p>
	“This guy from EMI is interested and going to be presenting it to the VP.”
</p><p>
	“We’re in talks to do a pilot for the fall.”
</p><p>
	“I’m getting ready to work on some new material with a hit writer.”
</p><p>
	These are the things some people have to tell themselves to be hopeful when facing another day of challenges.
</p><p>
	But of course these future things rarely end up happening.
	They don’t mention it again, and you politely don’t ask.
</p><p>
	I felt like wearing a t-shirt that says, “TELL ME WHEN IT HAPPENS.”
</p><p>
<strong>
	So now when I hear a future-tense sentence, my ears shut down.
</strong>
	I’ll wish them well, but I don’t believe a word.
</p><p>
	Try noticing this in yourself and others for a week.
	Are you speaking more in future tense or present tense?
	Are they?
</p><p>
	Remember that <a href="/zipit">announcing your plans makes them less likely to happen</a>.
