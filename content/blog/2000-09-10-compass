<!-- Compass in your gut -->
<p>
	Your instincts have a compass that points two directions:
</p><ol><li>
	what excites you
</li><li>
	what drains you
</li></ol>
<p>
	No matter what advice anyone gives you — no matter how smart they may be — you need to let this compass guide you.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Whatever excites you, go do it.
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>
	Whatever drains you, stop doing it.
</strong>
</p><p>
	For example:
	Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument.
	They love it so much they want to do it full-time.
	But then well-meaning people say, “If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on music business law, and you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and tech skills, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah.”
	Soon those musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing their instrument, and decide it’s not worth it!
	They give up, get a dumb job, and lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music seems tedious and overwhelming.
</p><p>
<strong>
	But nothing is worth losing your enthusiasm.
	Nothing!
</strong>
</p><p>
	Whatever excites you, go do it.
	Whatever drains you, stop doing it.
	You have to pay close attention to that compass, even in little day-to-day decisions.
</p><p>
	You get offered a gig.
	They’re on the phone waiting for an answer.
	Does it excite you or drain you?
</p><p>
	You hear about some new technology.
	People say you need to check out this new app.
	Does it excite you or drain you?
</p><p>
	If it doesn’t excite you, don’t do it.
<strong>
	There’s almost nothing that you <em>must</em> do.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Whatever you hate doing, someone out there loves doing it.
	So if it’s necessary, find them and let them do it.
</p><p>
	Work toward this ideal, and soon you’ll be doing only what excites you the most.
</p><p>
	Then you’ll find that doors open for you, opportunities come your way, and life seems to go easier, because you’re doing what you’re meant to do.
