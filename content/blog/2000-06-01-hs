<!-- Life is like high school. -->
<p>
	When you’re in high school, it’s all about popularity, cliques, and being cool.
</p><p>
	When you go to college, the focus shifts to academic achievement.
</p><p>
	Many people get out of college thinking the world will be like that — like the harder you work, the more you’ll be rewarded.
	But it’s not.
</p><p>
	Life is like high school.
	It’s all about how you come across, how social you are, what scene you’re in, being likeable, and being cool.
</p><p><strong>
	But you can make this work in your favor.
</strong></p><p>
	You can be your idealized self.
</p><p>
	You can be where things are happening.
</p><p>
	You can attend cool events, and invite people to join you.
</p><p>
	You can practice your social skills and be the kind of person that people like to help.
</p><p>
	You can approach this strategically, as if you were a new kid going to a new school, with a goal to be popular.
	It sounds shallow, but it works.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Be who they want to be.
</strong>
	In your role as a musician, it’s actually considerate!
</p><p>
	It’d be easier to put in no effort and be normal.
	Show up wearing whatever, take a normal photo, and be a regular person.
</p><p>
	But people want someone to look up to.
	Someone who’s not of their normal boring world.
	Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had the courage.
</p><p>
	It takes some extra effort to look and act cool instead of normal, but it’s considerate and part of your art.
</p><p>
	Look back at artists like Andy Warhol or Miles Davis, who were not only great at their art, but also knew how to play their image — to be cool.
