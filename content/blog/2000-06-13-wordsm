<!-- When your music can’t speak for itself -->
<p>
	On the radio, your music speaks for itself.
	People hear your music and like it or not.
</p><p>
	In concert, your music speaks for itself.
	Hearing and watching you perform is enough.
</p><p>
	But in every other situation, unless your music is already in their ears, your music can’t speak for itself.
<strong>
	The words that describe your music have to do the hard work.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Online, the description needs to be so interesting that people stop to click and listen.
</p><p>
	In word-of-mouth between friends, the description needs to be so memorable that people search for you later.
</p><p>
	In the music industry, the description needs to be so intriguing that busy people feel you’re worth their time.
</p><p>
<strong>
	These are the main ways you call attention to your music, so this is important.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Once you’re a household name, and your music is playing everywhere, you can stop describing it.
	But for now, you need to come up with a great description.
