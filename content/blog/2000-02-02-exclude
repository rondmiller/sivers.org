<!-- Proudly exclude most people. -->
<p>
	We love when someone hates the same thing we hate — especially if that thing is popular.
</p><p>
	We’re drawn to the confidence of someone who is not trying to please anyone.
	We admire a strong, defiant stand.
</p><p>
	You can use this to attract your future fans.
</p><p>
	You can say, “If you like Katy Perry, you’ll hate us.”
	Then people who hate Katy Perry will love that you said that and want to check you out.
</p><p>
	You can say, “Don’t listen to this if you’re happy with your life.”
	Then people who hate all that happy crap will be intrigued.
</p><p>
	Most musicians are trying to please everyone.
	So when you are not, it suggests that you’ve got the talent to back up your confidence.
</p><p>
	You can be like the doorman of your exclusive club.
	Maybe you refuse anyone who is over 30, or under 50.
	Maybe you refuse anyone wearing a suit, or anyone without a tattoo.
</p><p>
	There are some cool people around the world that would like your music.
	They may only be 1% of the population.
	But 1% of the world is 75 million people!
</p><p>
<strong>
	Loudly reject 99%.
	It signals who you are.
</strong>
	When someone in your target 1% hears you proudly excluding the rest, they’ll be drawn to you.
