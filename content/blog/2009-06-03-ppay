<!-- Some people like to pay. Let them. -->
<p>
	Not everyone is broke.
</p><p>
	When musicians put me on the guest list at a venue, I pay anyway.
	I like to support the venue and the artist.
</p><p>
	When the record label <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> let people pay as little as $5 to buy an album, they paid an average of $9.82.
	Many pay much more, because they know it goes to the artist.
</p><p>
	Radiohead’s album “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Rainbows">In Rainbows</a>” was offered for free, but 40% of people chose to pay for it anyway.
</p><p>
	It’s like donating money to their favorite charity.
	They don’t have to, but it makes them happy.
</p><p>
	When you’re offering something for free, don’t forget that there are lots of people that like to pay!
<strong>
	Appeal to this side of people, giving them a reason to pay that feels good.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Tell them what their payment will support.
	Show them how much you appreciate the purchase.
	It will actually make them happy to give you money.
