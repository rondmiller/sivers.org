<!-- Use the tricks that worked on you. -->
<p>
	Find a media outlet that writes about new music.
</p><p>
	You’ll read about so many artists that you’ve never heard of before, and see their photos too.
</p><p>
	Out of all of them, only one or two will really catch your attention.
</p><p>
	Why?
	I don’t have the answer.
	Only you do.
<strong>
	Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your attention.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Was it something about the opening sentence?
	Was it a curious tidbit about the singer’s background?
	What was it exactly that intrigued you?
</p><p>
	Analyze that.
	Use that.
	Adapt those techniques to write a headline or article about your music.
</p><p>
	This also helps you get into the mindset of seeing yourself from others’ point of view.
