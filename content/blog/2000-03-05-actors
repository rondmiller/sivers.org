<!-- A hundred actors on stage -->
<p>
	Imagine you’re in the audience of a play, and there are a hundred actors on stage.
</p><p>
	Which ones would stand out?
	Which ones would you remember?
</p><p>
	It’s not necessarily the loudest or most hyperactive.
	Maybe you’d be drawn to the woman with the long black hair, half-hidden, standing silently at the edge of the stage.
</p><p>
	Now you, as a musician, are one of the actors on that over-crowded stage.
</p><p>
	Would you stand out?
<strong>
	Would people know what you represent, at a glance?
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>
	Be identifiable, so that people who want you can find you in the crowd.
</strong>
</p><p>
	(Though don’t forget: the most memorable actor would be the one that talks with you after the show.)
