<!-- You don’t get extreme results without extreme actions. -->
<p>
	You can’t just normal your way through this.
</p><p>
	Extreme talent requires extreme practice — training like an Olympic athlete.
</p><p>
	Extreme success requires extreme focus — saying no to distractions and leisure.
</p><p>
	Extreme fame requires extreme ambition — taking the spotlight and its pressure.
</p><p>
	You can’t do what everyone else does.
	You can’t watch 63 hours of everyone’s favorite TV show.
	You can’t get two dogs that need you to be home.
	That’s for normal people who want a normal life.
	That’s not for you.
</p><p>
<strong>
	The music business is no place to be normal.
</strong>
	The more intense, the better.
	Normal people will think you’re insane.
	But your fellow achievers will welcome you to the exclusive club.
</p><p>
	When you are not practicing, someone somewhere is practicing.
	And when you meet him, he will win.
</p><p>
	Throw yourself into this entirely.
<strong>
	Find what you love and let it kill you.
