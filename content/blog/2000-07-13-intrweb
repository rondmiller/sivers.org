<!-- Your interactive website -->
<p>
	Your website can be your best tool, if you make it a two-way communication between you and your fans.
</p><p>
	Your website should get people involved, and make them want to communicate with you.

<strong>
	Get their email address!
</strong>
	Some people prefer a mailing list form.

</p><p>
	Encourage them to introduce themselves, make a request, or come to a show.
