<!-- Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote. -->
<p>
	Should you spend more time promoting right now?
</p><p>
	Or should you spend more time creating and improving?
</p><p>
	It’s a tough question.
	Lucky for you, I’ve got the answer.
</p><p>
	It comes down to one observation:
<strong>
	Are your fans telling their friends?
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>
	If not, then don’t waste time promoting it yet.
</strong>
	Keep working, improving, and creating, until your fans are telling their friends about you.
</p><p>
	To be clear, I don’t mean fans told friends because you asked them to!
	They can’t do it just to help you, like a favor.
	They have to do it just because they love your music so much that they’re doing their friends a favor by turning them on to you.
</p><p>
	Your music needs to be remarkable — so surprisingly good that others remark about it, like this.
</p><p>
	Until that point, you’re better off just improving and creating as much as you can.
</p><p>
