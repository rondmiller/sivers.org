<!-- Be a competent novice, not an expert. -->
<p>
	Don’t go too far down the rabbit hole of managing your little business.
</p><p>
<strong>
	It can become a brainless escape — a way to avoid the more open-hearted vulnerable work of making music.
</strong>
	Updating your website instead of practicing.
	Answering emails instead of writing a new song.
</p><p>
	Despite the fact that I talk so much about marketing, never forget that your music itself is always the most important thing.
	Unless your music is great, everything else is moot.
</p><p>
	Get to the point of being a competent novice at business, then let an expert take it further.
</p><p>
<strong>
	If you sense you are becoming an expert, figure out what you love more.
</strong>
	Maybe you’re a better publicist than bassist.
	Maybe you’re a better bassist than publicist.
</p><p>
	Maybe it’s time to admit your weakness as a booking agent, and hand it off to someone else.
	Maybe it’s time to admit your genius as a booking agent, and commit to it full-time.
</p><p>
<strong>
	You can do anything, but you can’t do everything.
</strong>
	You have to decide.
