<!-- Ego is the Enemy -->
<p>
	<a href="http://roadwritten.com/colors-between-black-and-white/">Meggan</a> asked <strong>why I don’t write more often</strong>.
</p><p>
	I told her it’s my minimalism, not wanting to put anything into the world unless necessary.
	And because of the size of my mailing list, I don’t want to bother people unless it’s really important.
</p><p><strong>
	She said, “Or maybe it’s ego.”
</strong></p><p>
	Ouch.
	She was right.
	Very right.
</p><p>
	I re-read my notes on the book “<a href="/book/EgoEnemy">Ego is the Enemy</a>”.
</p><p><em>
	“Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance.”
</em></p><p>
	Yep.
	Confirmed.
</p><p><strong>
	I feared releasing something unimportant, so I didn’t release anything at all.
</strong></p><p>
	If you would have asked me if I think I’m so important, I would have said no.
	But <strong><a href="/arv">actions, not words, reveal our real values</a></strong>.
</p><p>
	So, sorry that I’ve been so silent.
	I let my ego make excuses, then believed them.
