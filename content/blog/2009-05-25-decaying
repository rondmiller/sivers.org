<!-- Not what it used to be! -->
<p>
	At music-business conferences, there are always panels of experts, talking about the current state of the music business, from their point of view.
</p><p>
	They’re usually men over 50 who have been in the music business for 20 years, and they say things like:
</p><ul><li>
	“The music business isn’t what it used to be.”
</li><li>
	“It doesn’t have any vision anymore.”
</li><li>
	“Nobody knows what’s going on anymore.”
</li><li>
	“It’s too big and bloated and corrupt now.”
</li></ul>
<p>
	My friend <a href="http://www.clemchambers.com/">Clem Chambers</a> said, “Have you noticed <strong>they’re just projecting their own decaying health into things</strong>?”
</p><ul><li>
	They aren’t what they used to be.
</li><li>
	Their vision is fading.
</li><li>
	They don’t know what’s going on anymore.
</li><li>
	They’re big and bloated and corrupt.
</li></ul>
<p>
	So of course that’s how they’re going to see the world!
</p><p>
	Wouldn’t it be interesting to get a panel of under-20 musicians and entrepreneurs to talk about how the music business looks to them?
