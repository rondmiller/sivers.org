<!-- Don’t be afraid to ask for favors. -->
<p>
	Have you ever asked for directions in a city?
	People get a little ego boost when they know the answer to something you’re asking.
	They’ll gladly show off their knowledge.
</p><p>
	So don’t be afraid to ask for favors.
<strong>
	People like doing favors!
</strong>
</p><p>
	When I lived in New York City, one bold musician I know called me and said, “I’m coming to New York in two months. Can you give me a list of all the important contacts you think I should meet?”
	I laughed because I admired his directness!
	Then I emailed him a list of twenty people he should call.
</p><p>
	Sometimes you need to find something specific: a video director, a JavaScript programmer, a sitar player.
	Contact everyone you know and ask.
	Friends of friends will know how to get everything you want in life.
</p><p>
	Some people have time on their hands and would rather help you do something interesting instead of watching TV.
	Need help doing promotion?
	Need help getting equipment to a show?
<strong>
	Just ask them!
</strong>
</p><p>
	By making them feel important, connected, and needed, you’ll be doing them a favor, too.
