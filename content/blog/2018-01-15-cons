<!-- “Marketing” just means being considerate. -->
<p>
	Don’t confuse the word “marketing” with advertising, announcing, spamming, or giving away branded crap.
</p><p>
	Really, “marketing” just means being considerate.
</p><p>
	Marketing means making it easy for people to notice you, relate to you, remember you, and tell their friends about you.
</p><p>
	Marketing means listening for what people need, and creating something surprisingly tailored for them.
</p><p>
	Marketing means getting to know people, making a deeper connection, and keeping in touch.
</p><p>
	<strong>All of these are just considerate</strong> — looking at things from the other person’s point of view, and doing what’s best for them.
</p><p>
	A lot of musicians say, “I hate marketing!”
	So, yeah, if you thought marketing meant turning off your creativity, spending lots of money, and being annoying, then it’s a good thing you don’t like that.
	Nobody likes that.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Just find creative ways to be considerate.
</strong>
	That’s the best marketing.
