<!-- Promo bits, ready to copy -->
<p>
	This will save you so much time, and help you jump on so many more opportunities.
</p><p>
	Prepare, in advance, all of the things that people and companies ask for when you’re self-promoting.
</p><p>
	Make a folder on your computer called “promo” and put these things inside for quick easy access:
</p><p>
<strong>
	MP3s of your best songs.
</strong>
	Give each one a nice long name, without spaces, so that if anyone runs across it later, they know who it is.

<strong>
	An entertaining bio written four times, in four different lengths:
</strong>
</p>
<ol><li>
	Long bio. Over three paragraphs, 1-2 pages, exhaustive and rarely used.
</li><li>
	Medium length bio. 2-4 paragraphs. The maximum that people will read on a screen.
</li><li>
	Short bio. One great paragraph.
</li><li>
	One-liner. One great sentence.
</li></ol>
<p>
<strong>
	Quotes from reviews:
</strong>
</p>
<ol><li>
	One big text file with every review you’ve ever received, all typed out and credited.
</li><li>
	One text file with just the best short quotes from these reviews.
</li></ol>
<p>
<strong>
	Images, with a few different sizes of each:
</strong>
</p>
<ol><li>
	artist photos  (studio shot, live shot, up close, far away)
</li><li>
	album art graphics (big version, small version)
</li><li>
	your logo, if you have one
</li></ol>
<p>
	If you do this, just once, then the job of uploading your information to another website, or giving materials to a media outlet, will be painless.
	You can jump on every little opportunity that comes along.
</p><p>
	Bonus points if you have your own website, and put all of this stuff on a “promo” page on your site, so anyone else can get it all from one place, too.
