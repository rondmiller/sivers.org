<!-- Ignore advice that drains you. -->
<p>
	My music career was derailed when I took some advice from an expert.
</p><p>
	When my own music was at its peak success, a famous lawyer said he wanted to work with me.
	He said I should start a label, sign a few other artists, make them successful too.
	Then instead of getting me a simple artist deal, he could help me get a deal for the entire label for over a million dollars.
</p><p>
	I walked out of his office sad, but acknowledging that he was right.
<strong>
	That was the smartest thing to do to be a big success.
</strong>
	So that’s what I did.
	I stopped putting my full attention into my own music, and tried to sign and produce other artists.
</p><p>
	I spent two long years on this.
<strong>
	But the whole time, I hated it!
</strong>
	I only loved my own music.
	I only wanted to be an artist, not a label.
</p><p>
	So, as you can imagine, it didn’t go well.
	My label was a failure, and my own music career lost momentum because I lost focus.
</p><p>
	I wish I had paid attention to my emotions, and not wasted years of my life following someone’s advice.
</p><p>
	Point is:
	You’re going to hear a lot of advice.
	Listen to it all, but pay close attention to what it does to your energy and focus.
<strong>
	If it makes you jump into action, it’s good advice.
	If it makes you feel drained, sad, or lost, then it’s not for you.
