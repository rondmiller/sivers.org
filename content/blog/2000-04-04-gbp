<!-- A good plan wins no matter what happens. -->
<p>
	You don’t need a formal business plan.
	But you do need a plan.
<strong>
	So make two simultaneous plans.
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>
	Make one plan that depends on nobody else.
</strong>
	No record deal.
	No investors.
	No lucky break.
	Your profits may be small but sustainable.
	Grow your audience.
	Develop your skills.
	Build your reputation.
	You can happily continue this way indefinitely.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Make another plan that uses the music industry.
</strong>
	Build your team.
	Pursue a record deal.
	Find investors.
	Increase your odds of a lucky break.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Pursue these two plans simultaneously.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Then if a deal is offered to you, you can take it or leave it.
	It gives you great power in negotiation.
	You become a better investment when you don’t need their money.
	It shows that you’ll be successful whether they’re involved or not.
</p><p>
	If you’re prepared for either path, then your plan wins no matter what happens.
