<!-- Get specific! -->
<p>
	This is one of the most useful lessons I’ve learned in life.
</p><p>
	When you don’t know your next step…
<br/>
	When you’re feeling unmotivated…
<br/>
	When asking someone to help you…
<br/>
	When you’re ready to make a dream come true…
<br/>
<strong>
	Get more specific about what’s needed.
</strong>
</p><p>
	There are two ways to do it:
</p><p>
<strong>
	#1: Write down every detail you know.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Inside your head, there is more than you’ve said.
	Take the time to write it all down.
</p><p>
	When you have a vague or distant goal — like “be a great singer” or “make a million from my music” — break it down into specific ingredients.
	Describe concrete milestones, and exactly how to reach them.
	Then break those down into actions that you can start doing today.
</p><p>
	When you’re feeling stuck or unmotivated, figure out your next step.
	Even something as simple as finishing a song is easier when you realize exactly what’s wrong.
</p><p>
	When you hire someone to help you, write down absolutely everything you need them to do.
	Include every detail of every step, and your philosophy too.
</p><p>
<strong>
	#2: Research what you don’t know.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Most people know what they want, but don’t know how to get it.
	When you don’t know the next step, you procrastinate or feel lost.
	But a little research can turn a vague desire into specific actions.
</p><p>
	For example:
	When musicians say, “I need a booking agent”, I ask, “Which one? What’s their name?”
</p><p>
<strong>
	You can’t act on a vague desire.
</strong>
	But with an hour of research you could find the names of ten booking agents that work with ten artists you admire.
	Then you’ve got a list of the next ten people you need to contact.
</p><p>
	A life coach told me that most of his job is just helping people get specific.
	Once they turn a vague goal into a list of specific steps, it’s easy to take action.
</p><p>
<strong>
	It also makes you realize if something was a bad idea.
</strong>
	Many things only sound nice in theory.
</p><p>
	So do this for yourself.
	Take the time to get specific. 
	It helps you and others to take action, and beats procrastination.
