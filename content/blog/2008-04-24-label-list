<!-- If I had a record label, would you be signed to it? -->
<p>
	I never liked the idea of having a record label, because you’re too deeply invested into something you don’t <a href="/circles">control</a>.
</p><p>
	So if I were to have a label, my decision of who to sign wouldn’t be decided just by the quality of the music.
	There are plenty of people with great music but destructive work-habits or an unsustainable approach to their career.
</p><p>
<strong>
	To confidently invest in an artist (as a label), I’d want to see:
</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>
	every song has been absolutely improved repeatedly — every note/syllable crafted to be the best it can be
</li><li>
	vocal performance is not just perfect but striking
</li><li>
	arrangement is everything it can be to bring out the song
</li><li>
	arrangement offers a new idea to the world, and not just the usual paint-by-numbers
</li><li>
	photos/image are striking and amazing, and capture the essense of the music
</li><li>
	live show is so entertaining that even a deaf person would enjoy it
</li><li>
	band has been around, recording and gigging, for at least two years
</li><li>
	artist has done this for a few years and still believes that this is their real calling in life, regardless of external rewards (or total lack of)
</li><li>
	band members don’t need unreasonable amounts of money to perform (can perform profitably)
</li><li>
	band can entertain a crowd without props or big sound system (in-store appearances)
</li><li>
	off-stage persona is sustainable (stamina, dealing with fans well, etc)
</li><li>
	no addicts — to anything
</li><li>
	a persistently healthy attitude to the immense amount of work it really takes to be successful at anything
</li></ul>
<p>
	And so you see why I’ll never have a label.
	Who could possibly fit this list?
