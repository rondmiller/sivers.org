<!-- Creative communication -->
<p>
	The way you communicate with people is part of your art.
</p><p>
	For people who have never heard your music, it’s the <em>start</em> of your art!
</p><p>
	If you make depressing music, send your fans a dark black announcement that’s depressing just to look at.
</p><p>
	If you are an “in-your-face country-metal-speedpunk” artist, have the guts to call a potential booking agent and scream, “Listen you crazy dirtbag! Book me or I explode! Waaaaaah!!”
	If they like that introduction, you’ve found a good match.
</p><p>
	Set the tone.
	Pull in those people who love that kind of thing.
	<a href="/exclude">Proudly alienate</a> those that don’t.
</p><p>
	There’s a minimalist classical music composer whose emails to me are always just one provocative thought.
	Like when I posted something online about being an introvert, he emailed me just one sentence:
	“Are we not ever-changing, both gradually and per situation?”
	That’s it.
	No greeting or closing or manners in-between.
	His communication style always makes me smile, and reminds me of his music.
</p><p>
	The gentle new-age artist always calls me “sweetie” and reminds me to nourish my soul.
</p><p>
	The surf-music artist always uses the Hawaiian greetings “aloha” and “mahalo” when he emails, along with other surfer slang.
</p><p>
	The rebellious punk never calls me by my name, but instead just says, “Hey sellout.”
</p><p>
	Be different.
<strong>
	Show who you are.
</strong>
</p><p>
	It gives people’s lives more variety, too.
