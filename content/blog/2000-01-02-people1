<!-- It’s just people inside the machine! -->
<p>
	All those years I was trying to get famous, it felt like the music industry was this giant mysterious machine.
</p><p>
	I’d submit my music to showcases, and the machine would choose everyone else.
</p><p>
	I’d try to contact record labels, and the machine wouldn’t let me past the gate.
</p><p>
	I’d send my music to media outlets, and the machine would make it disappear.
</p><p>
	What a heartless machine!
	It felt like a complex puzzle that, if I was smart enough, I could figure out.
</p><p>
	But then, at age 20, I got a job inside the machine.
</p><p>
	Now I was given all-access. 
	I was treated as an insider and invited to all events.
	I talked with rock stars and their managers.
	I watched how people got in and how deals get made.
</p><p>
	The big epiphany came just a few weeks into the job.
</p><p>
	I had to call a major record label to get a copy of a new album.
	They put me on the phone with Stacy, who ran promotions out of their New York office.
	She was super-friendly, joking around on the phone, so we decided to meet up for lunch.
	She was a bubbly 24-year-old that was a huge music fan, had a degree in media studies, got this job as an intern, climbed the ranks a bit, and was now in charge of promotion.
</p><p>
	And that’s when it hit me:
</p><p>
	This whole music industry — this giant mysterious machine — is not a machine!
	It’s just people!
</p><p>
	More specifically, it’s mostly young people like Stacy, who have a lot in common with us musicians, and are totally cool and approachable.
</p><p>
	So it’s not heartless.
<strong>
	We just need to understand what it’s like to be them.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Once I connected with them as people — getting to know them and assuming they mean well — the machine started working for me.
