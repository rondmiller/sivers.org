<!-- The security of no security -->
<p>
	If you’re a full-time musician, you’ll never have a job, a boss, a salary, or insurance.
	You’ll bootstrap everything yourself.
	You’ll always struggle against apathy and gate-keepers.
	And you’ll have to be one-in-a-million to achieve this incredibly difficult goal.
</p><p>
	To some people, this sounds horrible.
	To me, it was a dream come true.
</p><p>
	Someone with a steady 9-5 job asked me how I could handle the lack of security.
</p><p>
	Lack of security?
<strong>
	Living this way is like learning wilderness survival skills.
	Being able to fend for yourself is real security.
</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>
	You’re constantly thrown into new scenarios, and learn something new every time.
</li><li>
	You’re not given a safety net, so you learn to make your own.
</li><li>
	Your career is not tied to any one company.
</li><li>
	Your success or failure is up to you — not the whims of a boss.
</li><li>
	You’re a free agent, so you can take any opportunity.
</li><li>
	Your pay is always negotiable.
	You can experiment in doubling your rates, or charging however you’d like.
</li></ul>
<p>
	Basically, having no steady job keeps you at your best!
	To me, it’s the ideal life.
