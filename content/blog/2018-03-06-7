<!-- My writing process -->
<p>
	This is what I do for <a href="/blog">everything I post</a>:
</p>
<ol><li>
	Write all of my thoughts on a subject.
</li><li>
	Argue against those ideas.
</li><li>
	Explore different angles until Iâ€™m sick of it.
</li><li>
	Leave it for a few days or years, then repeat those steps.
</li><li>
	Hate how messy these thoughts have become.
</li><li>
	Reduce them to a tiny outline of the key points.
</li><li>
<strong>
	Post the outline. Trash the rest.
</strong>
</li></ol>
