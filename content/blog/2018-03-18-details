<!-- Detailed dreams blind you to new means. -->
<p>
	There’s a fable of a man stuck in a flood.
	Convinced that God is going to save him, he says no to a passing canoe, boat, and helicopter that offer to help.
	He dies, and in heaven asks God why He didn’t save him.
	God says, “I sent you a canoe, a boat, and a helicopter!”
</p><p>
	We all have vivid imaginations.
	We get a goal in our mind and picture the path so clearly.
	Then it’s hard to stop focusing on that vivid image, to see what else could work.
</p><p>
	New technologies make old things easier, and new things possible.
<strong>
	That’s why you need to re-evaluate your old dreams to see if new means have come along.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Some actors move to Hollywood hoping to get noticed.
	Others use every new outlet to make themselves unavoidable.
</p><p>
	Some authors are just waiting for a publisher to sign them.
	Others are getting rich just self-publishing.
</p><p>
	You need to distinguish between what is your real goal, and what are the unnecessary details.
<strong>
	Don’t let the details distract you from your goal.
</strong>
</p><p>
	For each of your dreams, occasionally ask yourself what the real point is.
	Then look for a better way to get to that point.
</p><p>
	Let go of outdated dreams that keep you from noticing what’s here now.
