<!-- What’s inside this book -->

	Welcome to my book about getting your music to people, into people, and through people.

	You deserve a little preview of what’s inside, so I’m going to introduce you to all of its main ideas, right now, all at once.
	It’ll be a bunch of declarations in a row, like reading a table of contents, but it’ll give you an idea of what’s to come.
	Ready?
