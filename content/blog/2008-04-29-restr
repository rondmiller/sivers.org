<!-- Restrictions will set you free. -->
<p>
	Someone says, “Write me a piece of music. Anything. No restrictions. Go!”
</p><p>
	You’re stumped.
	It’s the blank page syndrome.
</p><p>
	Instead, someone says, “Write me a piece of music using only a flute, ukulele, and this toy piano.  You can only use the notes D, E, and B.  It has to start quiet, get louder, then end quietly.  Go!”
</p><p>
	Aha!
	Now that’s an inspiring challenge!
</p><p>
	You can use this approach for business, too.
<strong>
	If you’re feeling stuck with marketing, give yourself restrictions.
</strong>
</p><ul><li>
	Contact fifty fans using only personal emails — no mass-mailing.
</li><li>
	Make a music video using only stock footage.
</li><li>
	Give promotion a time-limit of just 15 minutes per day.
</li><li>
	Spend a week only contacting people you’ve never contacted before.
</li></ul><p>
	Whenever you’re feeling uninspired or unmotivated, use creative restrictions to set you free.
